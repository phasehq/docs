## Delete a Dynamic Secret

Click the **Delete** button next to the secret in the list.

<Warning>
Deleting a Dynamic Secret will immediately revoke all active leases and remove all associated credentials from your environment.
</Warning>

If there are active leases, you will need to confirm by toggling **Revoke all active leases**, then click **Delete Dynamic Secret**.
