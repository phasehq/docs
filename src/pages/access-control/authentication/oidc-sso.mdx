# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that allows applications to verify user identities. It enables secure authentication through trusted identity providers while eliminating the need for separate credentials. Phase supports OIDC-based SSO integration with major providers like Google, allowing seamless and secure access to your applications. Currently, OIDC authentication can be set up only for a Self-hosted Phase deployment.

<Note>
 OIDC SSO as an authentication method is only available for organizations with an `Enterprise` tier subscription. See [Pricing](https://phase.dev/pricing).
</Note>

## Google

Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and can be used to set up SSO. In fact, you can use your existing Google OAuth 2.0 credentials for OIDC authentication as long as you set the 'Authorized redirect URIs' correctly.

Follow these steps to set up Google SSO for your Phase application:

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click the "Select a project" dropdown.

   ![Select a project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/1-select-a-project.png)

2. Click "New project". If you already have a project you want to use, select it from the list and skip to step 5.

   ![New project select](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/2-new-project-select.png)

3. Enter a valid Project Name and click "Create".

   ![New project create](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/3-new-project-create.png)

4. Go to your newly created project by clicking "SELECT PROJECT" from the notifications.

   ![Go to new project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/4-go-to-new-project.png)

5. In your console's search box, type 'Credentials' and click on the result that says "Credentials - APIs & Services".

   ![Search credentials](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/5-search-credentials.png)

6. Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID". If this is your first time creating an OAuth credential, you'll need to set up a consent screen. If you've already set up a consent screen, skip to Step 13.

   ![Create OAuth client ID](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/6-create-oauth-client-id.png)

7. When prompted to configure an OAuth consent screen, click the "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button.

   ![Configure consent screen](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/7-first-time-consent-screen-config.png)

8. Choose "External" as the User Type for the OAuth consent screen.

   ![Create external consent screen](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/8-create-external-consent-screen.png)

9. Enter details for mandatory fields such as App name, User support email, and Developer contact information. Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE".

12. Review the details of your Consent screen app registration and click "BACK TO DASHBOARD".

    ![Consent screen back to dashboard](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/13-consent-screen-back-to-dashboard.png)

13. In the APIs & Services dashboard, click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID" from the dropdown.

    ![Select a project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/13-5-create-oauth-app.png)

14. In the Application type dropdown, select "Web application". Enter a recognizable name in the Name field, add the Authorized redirect URI (e.g., https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**].com/api/auth/callback/google-oidc), and click "CREATE".

   You can copy the following path, please make sure to pre-fix it with scheme + your domain.

   ```
   /api/auth/callback/google-oidc
   ```

    ![Create OAuth client ID config](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/google/14-create-oauth-client-id-config.png)

15. You will be presented with the OAuth Client ID and Client secret. Copy these by clicking the clipboard icon next to each.

## Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD

You can integrate Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) as an OIDC provider for your Phase instance. Follow these steps to set up Microsoft Entra ID SSO for Phase:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Microsoft account.

   ![Sign in to Azure Portal](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/0-signup-login-to-azure-portal.png)

2. Select "Microsoft Entra ID" from the side navigation blade or from Azure services. You can also search for "Microsoft Entra ID" in the search bar.

   ![Select Microsoft Entra ID](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/1-select-microsoft-entra-id-from-the-side-blade-or-from-azure-services.png)

3. In the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard, select "App registrations" from the Manage dropdown section in the sidebar.

   ![Select App registrations](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/2-select-app-registrations-from-under-the-manage-dropdown-in-entra-id-sidebar.png)

4. Click the "New registration" button in the top menu.

   ![Click New registration](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/3-click-new-registration-button-from-the-top-option-bar.png)

5. Provide a name for your application, select the supported account types, you will have a choice between:
   - Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)
   - Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) 
   - Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (Multi-tenant)

   For most users this will be "**Accounts in this organizational directory only - Single tenant**" 
   
   In the Redirect URI section, select "Web" and add the appropriate redirect URI for your Phase instance (e.g., https://[**YOUR_DOMAIN**].com/api/auth/callback/entra-id-oidc).

   You can copy the following path, please make sure to pre-fix it with scheme + your domain.

   ```
   /api/auth/callback/entra-id-oidc
   ```

   Click "Register" to create the application.

   ![Configure application registration](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/4-supply-a-name-select-scope-of-access-add-redirection-uri-click-register.png)

6. Once your application is registered, copy the "Application (client) ID" from the Overview page. This will be used as your `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`.

   ![Copy Application Client ID](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/5-copy-application-client-id.png)

7. Still on the Overview page, copy the "Directory (tenant) ID". This will be used as your `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_TENANT_ID`.

   ![Copy Directory Tenant ID](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/6-copy-directory-tenand-id.png)

8. Select "Certificates & secrets" under the Manage dropdown section in the sidebar.

   ![Select Certificates & secrets](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/7-select-certificates-&-secrets-from-under-the-manage-dropdown-in-the-app-sidebar.png)

9. In the Client secrets tab, click "New client secret".

   ![Create new client secret](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/8-click-new-client-secret-under-the-client-secrets-tab.png)

10. Provide a description for your client secret and select an appropriate expiration period, we suggest >= 730 days (24 months) then click "Add".

   <Note>
    Your Entra ID OIDC authentication will stop working, once the client secret expires. To prevent being locked out of your Phase instance unexpectedly, please set a reminder on your calendar to duly renew it.
   </Note>

    ![Configure client secret](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/9-provide-client-secret-description-and-expiry.png)

11. Immediately copy the generated client secret value. This will be used as your `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Note that you will not be able to view this value again after leaving this page.

    ![Copy client secret value](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/10-copy-the-client-secret-value.png)

12. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as environment variables:
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_TENANT_ID`
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`

    Please see [deployment configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#microsoft-entra-id-oidc) for more details.

Your Microsoft Entra ID SSO application is now configured! You can now provision user access to your Phase instance by adding the application to individual users in your Microsoft Entra ID directory or to groups of users.

For more detailed information about Microsoft Entra ID application registration and OIDC configuration, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
