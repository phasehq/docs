# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that allows applications to verify user identities. It enables secure authentication through trusted identity providers while eliminating the need for separate credentials. Phase supports OIDC-based SSO integration with major providers like Google, allowing seamless and secure access to your applications. Currently, OIDC authentication can be set up only for a Self-hosted Phase deployment.

<Note>
 OIDC SSO as an authentication method is only available for organizations with an `Enterprise` tier subscription. See [Pricing](https://phase.dev/pricing).
</Note>

## Google

Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and can be used to set up SSO. In fact, you can use your existing Google OAuth 2.0 credentials for OIDC authentication as long as you set the 'Authorized redirect URIs' correctly.

Follow these steps to set up Google SSO for your Phase application:

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click the **Select a project** dropdown.

   ![Select a project](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/1-select-a-project.png)

2. Click **New project**. If you already have a project you want to use, select it from the list and skip to step 5.

   ![New project select](/assets/images/auth/sso/google/2-new-project-select.png)

3. Enter a valid Project Name and click **Create**.

   <Note>
    Your Entra ID OIDC authentication will stop working, once the client secret expires. To prevent being locked out of your Phase instance unexpectedly, please set a reminder on your calendar to duly renew it.
   </Note>

    ![Configure client secret](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/9-provide-client-secret-description-and-expiry.png)

11. Immediately copy the generated client secret value. This will be used as your `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Note that you will not be able to view this value again after leaving this page.

    ![Copy client secret value](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/10-copy-the-client-secret-value.png)

12. Supply these credentials to your Phase Console deployment as environment variables:
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_TENANT_ID`
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
    - `ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`

    Please see [deployment configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#microsoft-entra-id-oidc) for more details.

13. (Optional) Configure additional application properties by navigating to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise Applications** > **All applications** > select the app you just created (Phase Console) > under the *Manage* dropdown in the left sidebar, select **Properties**. These settings help customize the appearance and access controls for your application.

    ![Application Properties Options](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/11-optional-visibility-assignment-options.png)

    You can configure:
    
    - **Homepage URL**: Set this to your Phase application's homepage (e.g., https://acme.com)
    
    - **Logo**: Upload a custom logo for your application that will appear in the Microsoft Entra ID portal and user sign-in experiences
    
    - **Assignment required**: This important setting controls access to your application:
      - If set to **Yes**: Users or groups must be explicitly assigned to the application before they can access it
      - If set to **No**: All users or groups in your directory can access the application without assignment
    
    - **Visibility options**: These settings control whether the application appears in user portals (e.g., https://myapplications.microsoft.com)

Your Microsoft Entra ID SSO application is now configured! You can now provision user access to your Phase instance by adding the application to individual users in your Microsoft Entra ID directory or to groups of users.

For more detailed information about Microsoft Entra ID application registration and OIDC configuration, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

### Troubleshooting: Microsoft Entra ID

#### Issue: Need Admin Approval

If users encounter a "Need admin approval" screen while trying to log into the Phase Console, asking them to either sign in with an admin account or return to the application without granting consent:

![Need Admin Approval Screen](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/need-admin-approval-error.png)

Resolve this by following these steps:

1. Log into the Azure Portal as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise Applications**
3. Select the application you have set up (Phase Console)
4. Under the *Security* dropdown in the left sidebar, select **Permissions**
5. Click **Grant admin consent for \<Your Organization\>** as shown in the screenshot below

![Granting Admin Consent](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/microsoft-entra-id/grant-admin-consent-security-permission.png)

After granting admin consent, users should be able to log in without seeing the "Need admin approval" message on the consent screen.

#### Issue: User Email Missing

If a user is unable to log in to the Phase Console and upon reviewing the frontend logs you see the following error:

```fish
phase-frontend-dev | message: 'User does not have a valid email'.
```

This error suggests that the Phase Console was unable to fetch the user's email during authentication. This is most common for users that have been created in Entra ID manually by an administrator without an email address.

<Note>
A valid email address is a requirement to sign up or log in to the Phase Console.
</Note>

To resolve this:

1. Log into the Azure Portal as an Administrator
2. Navigate to **Entra ID**
3. Select **Users** under the *Manage* dropdown
4. Select the user who is having trouble logging in
5. Click **Edit properties**
6. Click **Contact information**
7. Add the user's email address
8. Click **Save**

After adding the email address to the user's profile, they should be able to log in successfully.


## Okta

You can use Okta as an OIDC provider to set up SSO for your Phase instance. Follow these steps to set up an Okta SSO application for Phase:

1.  Go to the [Okta Admin Dashboard](https://admin.okta.com/), enter your organization URL, and log in. In the sidebar, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**.

    ![Access Okta Applications](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/okta/1-click-on-applications.png)

2.  Click on the **Create App Integration** button.

4.  On the **New Web App Integration** page, configure the following:
    -   Enter an **App integration name** (e.g., "Phase Console").
    -   Under **Sign-in redirect URIs**, add your Phase application's redirect URI. This will be the hostname of your instance followed by:

    ```
    /api/auth/callback/okta-oidc
    ```
    (e.g., `https://[YOUR_PHASE_HOST]/api/auth/callback/okta-oidc`).

    - For sign-out redirect URIs, add your Phase application's sign-out redirect URI. This will be the hostname of your instance. eg. `https://[YOUR_PHASE_HOST]`.

    ![Configure App Name and Redirect URI](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/okta/4-setup-app-enter-name-redirection-url.png)

5.  Next, scroll down to view the **Assignments** section, select who should have access to this application. For the purposed of this guide we are going to choose **Allow everyone in your organization to access**. Please feel free to scope this down to a specific group of users if you prefer. Click **Save**.

    ![Configure Assignments and Save](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/okta/5-setup-assginemnts-click-save.png)

    ![Copy Client Credentials](/assets/images/auth/sso/oidc/okta/6-copy-credentials.png)

7.  Supply these credentials, along with your Okta domain (e.g., `https://acme-1234567.okta.com`), to your Phase Console deployment as [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#okta-oidc).

   - `OKTA_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
   - `OKTA_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `OKTA_OIDC_ISSUER`
  
  You can find more detailed information in the [official Okta documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm).
