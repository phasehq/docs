# External Identities

External Identities allow you to use third-party platforms and services to serve as identity providers for clients seeking programmatic access to Phase. Instead of manually provisioning access tokens for each client on each machine or an instance on your infrastructure, you can use External Identities to establish a trusted relationship with a principal that will be used to validate the identity of the client and grant access to Phase. This enables dynamic authentication and authorization for clients such as the CLI, SDKs, Kubernetes Operator, or your own applications. 

<DocActions /> 

Example use case: Imagine you have a fleet of EC2 instances in an autoscaling group (ASG) that runs an instance of your application. The Phase CLI is configured to inject secrets into your applications at runtime. Instead of manually provisioning access tokens for each client on each machine, you can use External Identities to establish a trusted relationship with an instance profile attached to the ASG.

The authentication flow will be as follows:

<Diagram caption="External Identities authentication with AWS IAM">
{`
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Client
  participant Phase as Phase
  participant AWS as AWS STS

  Note over Client,AWS: 1. GetCallerIdentity()
  Client->>AWS: Fetch GetCallerIdentity from STS
  AWS-->>Client: Return AWS Sigv4 signed GetCallerIdentity

  Note over Client,Phase: 2. Authenticate
  Client->>Phase: POST Sigv4 signed GetCallerIdentity to /identities/external/v1/aws/iam/auth/

  Note over Phase,AWS: 3. Validate signature
  Phase->>AWS: Forward Sigv4 signed GetCallerIdentity
  AWS-->>Phase: Return IAM user/role metadata

  Note over Phase: 4. Check entity trust relationship - is client a trusted principal?
  Phase->>Client: Return Access Token with a specified TTL

  Note over Client,Phase: 5. Authenticate to API with Access Token
  Client->>Phase: Make authenticated requests using the Access Token
`}
</Diagram>

Benefits:
- Automate the creation and provisioning of access tokens for every client on your infrastructure.
- Automatic token revocation after expiry
- Centralized management of trust relationships

## Prerequisites
- Server-side encryption (SSE) enabled for the Service Account you want to use the External Identity with.
- A third-party platform or service that supported by Phase

## Supported External Identity Providers
Phase currently supports the following external identity providers:

- [**AWS IAM**](#aws-iam): Bind an AWS IAM User to a phase Service Account

## Configure an External Identity

To set up an External Identity for use with a Phase Service Account, follow these steps. First, navigate to the **Access Control** page from the sidebar, and select **External Identities**. Then, choose a provider:

![external identities page](/assets/images/console/access-control/external-identities/external-identities.png)

Then, enter the required information to configure the external identity. For all providers, you will need to provide basic information about the identity and how tokens are generated:

<Properties>
  <Property name="Identity Name" type="string">
    A name for the external identity.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Description" type="string">
    Optionally, a description for the external identity.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Token name" type="string">
    Optional name for tokens that will be generated for Service Accounts using this external identity. The default is the provider shortcode, e.g. `aws-iam`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Token Default TTL" type="number">
    The default TTL (in seconds) for tokens generated for Service Accounts using this external identity. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
  </Property>
  <Property name="Token Max TTL" type="number">
    The default TTL (in seconds) for tokens generated for Service Accounts using this external identity. Default is 86400 seconds (24 hours).
  </Property>
</Properties>

Additionally, you will need to provide provider-specific information depending on the selected provider.

### AWS IAM

For AWS IAM, you will need to provide the following information:

<Properties>
  <Property name="Trusted principal ARNs" type="comma-separated-string">
    The ARN(s) of the AWS IAM User(s) to bind to the Phase Service Account. Separate multiple ARNs with commas.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Signature expiry" type="number">
    The duration (in seconds) for which the signed requests from the AWS IAM User will be valid. Default is 60 seconds. Lower the better. This is to protect against replay attacks.
  </Property>
  <Property name="STS endpoint" type="string">
    Optionally, specify a custom AWS STS endpoint. If not provided, the default AWS STS endpoint will be used (`https://sts.amazonaws.com`).
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Manage External Identities

Once an External Identity is created, it will appear in the list on the **External Identities** page. From here, you can view details, edit configurations, or delete the identity. 

![external identities list](/assets/images/console/access-control/external-identities/external-identities-list.png)

## Bind an External Identity to a Service Account

<Note>
To use an External Identity, the Service Account must have [Server-side KMS](/access-control/service-accounts#server-side-kms) enabled.
</Note>

Once you have configured an External Identity, you can bind it to a Phase Service Account. To do this, navigate to the **Service Accounts** page, select the desired Service Account and click **Mange** to open the account detail page. Scroll down to the **External Identities** section and click **Manage External Identities**:

![manage external identities button](/assets/images/console/access-control/external-identities/manage-account-identities-button.png)

From the dialog, select the External Identity you want to bind to this Service Account and enable it using the toggle switch. Click **Save** to apply the changes:

## Authenticate with External Identities

Once you have configured an External Identity and bound it to a Service Account, you can authenticate using the Phase CLI with your AWS credentials.

### CLI Authentication

To authenticate using an External Identity, use the `phase auth` command with the `--mode aws-iam` option:

```fish
# Authenticate using your current AWS identity
phase auth --mode aws-iam --service-account-id 0f1a2b3c-4d5e-6789-abcd-ef0123456789
```

You can also specify additional options:

```fish
# Authenticate with a custom TTL and print token to STDOUT
phase auth --mode aws-iam --service-account-id 0f1a2b3c-4d5e-6789-abcd-ef0123456789 --ttl 3600 --no-store
```

**Options:**
- `--service-account-id` (Required): The ID of the Service Account that has the External Identity bound to it
- `--ttl` (Optional): Token TTL in seconds. Defaults to the configured Default TTL of the external identity
- `--no-store` (Optional): Print the access token & metadata to STDOUT without logging in

### API Authentication

You can also authenticate programmatically using the Phase API. For detailed information about the authentication endpoints and request formats, see the [Public API documentation](/public-api/external-identities).
