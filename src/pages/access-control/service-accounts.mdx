# Service Accounts

Service Accounts provide a secure and controlled method for programmatic access to the Phase platform. Service accounts are non-human users that can use various authentication mechanisms to access resources such as secrets within the applications and environments it has been granted access to. 

Service accounts share many of the properties and behavior of human user accounts. Service Accounts follow an Access Policy that can be defined by [Managed Roles](/access-control/roles#managed-roles) or [Custom Roles](/access-control/roles#creating-custom-roles) based on the permissions required. Service accounts are secured with the same security and cryptographic architecture as user accounts, and must be manually provisioned access to Apps and Environments in order to access secrets. 

## Create a new Service Account

To create a new Service Account:

1. Navigate to Access Control page from the sidebar and click on the **Service Accounts** tab.

3. Give your new service account an Account name and choose a Role and Click "Create Service Account".

By default, when you create a new Service Account it uses the [Service](/access-control/roles#service) role that's managed by Phase which only has access to secrets at the Application level.

[Service](/access-control/roles#service) role secret access policy:

| Resource | Access | Read | Create | Update | Delete |
|----------|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Secrets** | Full access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

You may choose to select a different Managed role or a Custom role by clicking the one from the dropdown.

Click "Create service account". This will create a new account with the chosen name and role. 

<Note>
Creating a Service Account can take a few seconds as a unique encryption keyring is generated for each account. Do not close the tab or navigate away from this page during this process. You can find out more about this process in the [security architecture](/security/architecture#user-keys) page
</Note>

Once the account is created, you will see it listed in the table.
