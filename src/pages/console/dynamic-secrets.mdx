# Dynamic Secrets

Dynamic Secrets are credentials for third-party services that are *leased* on-demand for a limited time. Leases are tied to a specific account, and can be renewed to extend their validitiy, or revoked manually before they expire. Dynamic Secrets reduce the attack surface of your secrets by limiting the lifespan of active credentials and ensuring that each user has their own set of credentials. 
Dynamic Secrets can be created manually or automatically through integrations with external systems.

 The ability to create and manage Dynamic Secrets is available for organizations with an `Enterprise` tier subscription.

## Supported Providers

Dynamic Secrets are support for the following providers:

- [AWS IAM](/integrations/platforms/aws-iam)


## Create a Dynamic Secret

To create a Dynamic Secret, navigate to the "Secrets" tab in the Phase Console, and open a specific Environment. Click on the "Create Dynamic Secret" button to open the creation form. 

<Note>
You need to Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab to use Dynamic Secrets.

Choose a provider, and then fill in the required fields. The required configuration will vary for each provider, but all dynamic secrets will required: 

- **Secret Name**: A unique name for the secret.
- **Description**: A brief description of the secret.
- **Max TTL**: The maximum time-to-live for the secret. This is the maximum duration that the credentials can be leased for. After this time, the credentials will be automatically deleted.
- **Default TTL**: The default time-to-live for the secret. This is the default duration that the credentials will be leased for when they are created. This value must be less than or equal to the Max TTL.
- **Outputs**: This is a mapping of secrets or credentials created on the third-party service, and how they will be mapped to secrets in your Phase Environment.. These fields will vary depending on the provider.
