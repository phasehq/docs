# Quickstart

Setup your account and start using Phase to manage your application secrets in just a few minutes.

This guide will walk you through creating an account and securing it with a recovery phrase and `sudo` password. Then we'll create an [App](/console/apps), connect it to our local project and import our [Secrets](/console/secrets).
This guide assumes you have a project running locally with environment variables in a `.env` file.
The example `.env` file we are using in this guide is:

```
FOO=bar
DEBUG=yes
BACKEND_API_URL=https://api.myapp.com
```

## Login and create an Organisation

You can login to the Phase <a href="https://console.phase.dev" target="_blank">console</a> with Google, GitHub or GitLab.

[Setup your account](/console/users#account-keys-and-setup) and [create an Organisation](/console/organisation#create-an-organisation).

## Create an App

In order to use Phase with your application, you'll need to [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).

Enter a name for your like 'TestApp' and turn off the 'Create example secrets' switch. Click "Create"

## Install the CLI

Next, we need to [install the Phase CLI](/cli/install) on our machine. Use the option relevant to your platform and go through the installation process.

## Authenticate the CLI

Once the CLI is installed, we need to conenct it with our Phase account and App.

Run `phase auth` and choose the "Phase Cloud" option:

```
» phase auth
? Choose your Phase instance type: (Use arrow keys)
 » ☁️ Phase Cloud
   🛠️ Self Hosted
```

This will open the Phase Console in a new tab. Enter your sudo password when prompted.

![webauth password](/assets/images/console/quickstart/webauth-password.png)

Once complete, you should see the success screen:

![webauth success](/assets/images/console/quickstart/webauth-success.png)

Go back to your terminal. You should see the following:

```
✅ Authentication successful. Credentials saved in the Phase keyring.
🎉 Welcome to Phase CLI!

```

Lastly, run `phase init` and select 'TestApp' or the name of the App you created.

```
»  phase init
? Select an App: (Use arrow keys)
 » TestApp
   Landing page
   Exit
```

## Import your secrets into Phase

Next, lets import our secrets from our .env file.

Run `phase secrets import .env`

```
»  phase secrets import .env
Successfully imported and encrypted 3 secrets.
To view them please run: phase secrets list

```

Lets get rid of our `.env` file now:

```
rm .env
```

The environment variables in our `.env` file have now been encrypted and imported into your Phase app. Go back to your App in the Phase Console to view them:

![console secrets](/assets/images/console/quickstart/quickstart-console-secrets.png)

Our environment variables have been imported into the Development Environment by default. Now we can edit, manage and deploy these secrets from Phase.

## Next steps

Now that you have setup your account and connected it to your local project, you can explore all that Phase has to offer.
