# Secrets

Secrets are key/value pairs used to store application secrets or environment variables for your applications. Secrets in Phase can additionally have tags and comments associated with them. All changes to secrets are logged and viewable from the secret history or App logs screens.

## Create a Secret

To create a Secret in a specific Environment, click the "Create new secret" button. This will create a new empty secret, with a blank key and value. Enter the desired key and value and click "Deploy" to save your changes.

**Note: Secrets cannot be empty, or have the same 'key' as another secret in this Environment**

## Secret Referencing

You can use the value of other secrets inside a given secret across environments and folders. This may be useful for things like database connection strings.

Example:

```fish
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
DB_USER=j_mclaren
DB_PASSWORD=2ff9853e23b68587480da26a478b782aa8aeafe46ec716d0667ad7078870c345
DB_HOST=mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=XP1_LM

# will resolve to:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://j_mclaren:6c37810ec6e74ec3228416d2844564fceb99ebd94b29f4334c244db011630b0e@mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/XP1_LM
```

### Secret referencing syntax:

| Value reference syntax | Environment | Path | Secret Key Being Referenced | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| `${KEY}` | same environment | `/` | KEY | Local reference in the same environment and path root (/). |
| `${staging.DEBUG}` | `staging` | `/` (root of staging environment) | DEBUG | Cross-environment reference to a secret at the root (/). |
| `${production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}` | `production` | `/frontend/` | SECRET_KEY | Cross-environment reference to a secret in a specific path. |
| `${/backend/payments/STRIPE_KEY}` | same environment | `/backend/payments/` | STRIPE_KEY | Local reference with a specified path within the same environment. |

## Override a Secret (Personal Secrets)

You can override the value of Secret with a Personal Secret. This can be useful for using API keys, authentication credentials or other environment variables that are unique to your development setup without having to modify the environment for other users.
When applied, the overridden value of the Secret will only be visible to you.
When developing locally with the Phase CLI, the override value will be used by default.

To create a Personal Secret, click on the "Override" button for a secret.

Then simply enter the value you wish override this secret with. You can also control whether a Personal Secret override is active or not with the "Activate Secret Override" switch.

## Tag a Secret

To apply a tag to a Secret, hover on the Secret row and click on "Tags" in the secret key input box to open the Tags dialog.
You can select one or more tags to apply to this Secret, or create new Tags if required.

All tags applied to a secret will be displayed inline with the secret name.

**Note: Secret tags are not saved till you "Deploy" changes to the Environment**

## Add comments to a Secret

To add comments to a Secret, hover in the Secret row, and click on the "Comment" button in the value input box to open the comment dialog. Type your comment and close the dialog.

Secrets with comments will be identifiable by a green comment icon.

**Note: Secret tags are not saved till you "Deploy" changes to the Environment**

## View Secret history

You can view the entire history of a Secret by hovering on the Secret row and clicking the "History" button.
This dialog shows a timeline of changes to all properties of this secret, with timestamps and user information for each change.

You can also restore the "Value" of a secret from history by clicking the "Restore" button. This will update the value of the Secret, and will be saved when you next Deploy your changes.
