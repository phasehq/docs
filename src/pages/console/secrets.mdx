# Secrets

Secrets are key/value pairs used to store application secrets or environment variables for your applications. Secrets in Phase can additionally have tags and comments associated with them. All changes to secrets are logged and viewable from the secret history or App logs screens.

## Create a Secret

To create a Secret in a specific Environment, click the "Create new secret" button. This will create a new empty secret, with a blank key and value. Enter the desired key and value and click "Deploy" to save your changes.

**Note: Secrets cannot be empty, or have the same 'key' as another secret in this Environment**

## Tag a Secret

To apply a tag to a Secret, hover on the Secret row and click on "Tags" in the secret key input box to open the Tags dialog.
You can select one or more tags to apply to this Secret, or create new Tags if required.
