# Users

Learn how User accounts work in Phase.

## Account keys & Signup

Phase is end-to-end encrypted, which means that each member of an [Organisation](/console/organisation) has a unique set of encryption keys.
These keys are used to cryptographically assign or revoke access to specific [Environments](/console/environments) and [Secrets](/console/secrets).

When you signup or accept an Organisation invite for Phase, you will need to go through a 2-step process to create and secure your account keys.

### Step 1: Create a sudo password

First, you must create a strong password, known as the `sudo` password. We call it this, because it used to secure your account encryption keys. 
Certain action that require access to your account keys can only be preformed when your account keyring is unlocked by entering this password.

The sudo password must:

- be 16 characters or longer
- contain letters or numbers

We suggest using a long phrase that you can remember easily.

### Step 2: Save your account recovery kit

In case you lose or forget your `sudo` password, you will need a recovery phrase to restore your account keys. This step provides you with a downloadable recovery kit that you can print out and store somewhere safe. 
You can also copy the entire contents of the recovery kit to store as a secure note in a password manager or digital wallet. You can choose either option, but we recommend both.

<Warning>
  Make sure to save your recovery kit in a safe place! If you forget your `sudo`
  passsword, it is the **only** way to regain access to your account.
</Warning>

## `sudo` password

Your `sudo` password is used to encrypt your account keys. Performing certain priveleged actions such as creating Apps, managing Environments and Tokens, or managing User access requires access to your account keys.

The first time you perform such an action, you will be asked to enter your `sudo` password.

When entered correctly, your account keys will be decrypted and held in memory. You will not need to enter this password again for the duration of your session, unless you close the tab or reload the page using the browser 'refresh' action.

## User roles

Users in Phase can have 3 possible roles:

- Owner
- Admin
- Developer

### Owner

When you create an Organisation, you are designated as the `Owner`. You will have access to all Apps, Environments and Secrets. Owners have all permissiont to Manage Users in the Organisation including inviting new members, removing members, updating member app accesss and member roles.

### Admin

`Admin` accounts essentially have the same permissions as Owners. They have access to all Apps and Envs, and can manage all administrative functions of the Organisation including adding or removing members and chaning member roles.

### Developer

When a user in invited to an Organisation, they are assigned the `Developer` role by default.
Developers have limited access to specific Apps and Environments. Developers cannot delete Apps, Environments or Members, but can create, edit and delete Secrets within the Environments they have access to.

## Add users to an Organisation

You can add a user as an Organistion member by inviting them from the [Organisation members](/console/organisation#members) screen.

To invite a new member, click on the "Add a member" button, enter the email of the user you wish to invite, optionally select which Apps they will have access to, and click "Invite".

<Note>
Note: Invited members will not have access to any Environments after joining your organisation. Once they accept your invite, you may assign them a role and grant them access to specific Environments from the App Members screen.

</Note>

## Update member roles

If you are an `Owner` or `Admin`, you can update a member's role from the [Organisation members](/console/organisation#members) screen.

### Upgrade a User to `Admin`

When you upgrade a `Developer` account to `Admin`, they will be given access to all Apps, Environments and Secrets in the Organisation.

### Downgrade a User to `Developer`

When you downgrade an `Admin` account to `Developer`, they will retain access to all Apps, Environments and Secrets in the Organisation. You can limit their access to specific Apps or Environments by vising the respective App Members screen.

## Remove a member from an Organisation

You can permanently remove a member from an Organsation from the [Organisation members](/console/organisation#members) screen. To remove a member, click on the "Remove member" button beside their name.
