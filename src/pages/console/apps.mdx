# Apps

A Phase App is used to manage [Secrets](/console/secrets) for a single project, repo or application. An App can contain multiple [Environments](/console/environments). Users can be added or removed from an App to manage access.

## Create an App

Create an App by clicking on the "+" button on the Apps screen. Enter a name for your app, and your `sudo` password if prompted.
You can also optionally choose to initialize your app with some example secrets. This is automatically selected for your first App.

## Secrets

This screen shows an overview of all Secrets in this App, across all Environments. You can explore a specific Environment by clicking the Environment name in the column headers.
You can expand a secret to view its status in each environment. Clicking on an Environment name will take you to this secret in the respective Environment management screen.

## Service Tokens

This screen lets you create and manage [Service Tokens](/console/tokens#service-tokens) for this App.

## Logs

This screen shows you audit logs for all CRUD events for all Secrets and Environments in this app. You can expand a specific log event to view more information.

### Add a member to an App

To add a member to an App, click on the "Add a member" button. Select an Organization member from the dropdown list, select which Environments to grant them access to, and click "Add"

### Update Environment access for a member

To update the Environments that a specific user can access, click the "Manage user access" button. Update the Environment selection and click "Save"

### Remove a member from an App

To remove a member from an App, click the "Remove member" button.

## Secret Syncing Integrations

Phase offers the ability to automatically sync secrets to various third-party platforms and services. This feature allows for seamless deployment of secrets to services like GitHub Actions, Railway, AWS Secrets Manager, and Hashicorp Nomad.

### Requirements for Syncing

1. Server-Side Encryption (SSE) must be enabled for the App to use secret syncing integrations. This allows Phase to securely manage and deploy secrets to external services.
2. Appropriate permissions and access tokens for the target service must be configured.

### Setting Up a Sync

To set up a new sync:

1. Navigate to the "Syncing" tab in your App.
2. Click on "Create a new sync" and select the desired service.
3. Follow the prompts to configure the sync, including selecting the environment and specific secrets to sync.

Syncing allows Phase to keep your secrets up-to-date across different platforms automatically. This ensures consistency and reduces manual secret management tasks.


## Settings

This screen shows you metadata for the App and allows you to perform administrative tasks such as changing the Encryption mode of the App or deleting it permanently.

### Encryption

Phase Apps are secured with end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default. This means only users who are granted access to the App and its Environments can decrypt the secrets that are stored within it.
However, in order to use certain features of Phase such as third-party integrations or the [public REST API](/public-api), you will need to enable server-side encryption (SSE).
Enabling SSE will store a copy of each Environment's root key on the server, encrypted with the server's encryption key. This allows the server to decrypt secrets for syncing with third parties, or to make them available over the API.

### Enabling SSE

To enable SSE for an App, click on the "Enable SSE" button under the "Encryption" section of the App Settings tab.

Click "Enable" on the confirmation dialog:

Once enabled, the settings page will show you the updated Encryption mode:

### Delete an App

To delete an app, click on the "Delete" button in the Settings tab.

<Warning>
 Deleting an app will permanently delete all Environments, Secrets and Tokens
 associated with it.
