# Apps

A Phase App is used to manage [Secrets](/console/secrets) for a single project, repo or application. An App can contain multiple [Environments](/console/environments). Users can be added or removed from an App to manage access.

## Create an App

Create an App by clicking on the "+" button on the Apps screen. Enter a name for your app, and your `sudo` password if prompted.

You can also optionally choose to initialize your app with some example secrets. This is automatically selected for your first App.

## Secrets

This screen shows an overview of all Secrets in this App, across all Environments. You can explore a specific Environment by clicking the Environment name in the column headers.

You can expand a secret to view its status in each environment. Clicking on an Environment name will take you to this secret in the respective Environment management screen.

### Remove a member from an App

To remove a member from an App, click the "Remove member" button.

## Settings

This screen shows you metadata for the App and allows you to perform administrative tasks such as changing the Encryption mode of the App or deleting it permanently.

### Encryption
Phase Apps are secured with end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default. This means only users who are granted access to the App and its Environments can decrypt the secrets that are stored within it.

However, in order to use certain features of Phase such as third-party integrations or the [public REST API](/public-api), you will need to enable server-side encryption (SSE).

Enabling SSE will store a copy of each Environment's root key on the server, encrypted with the server's encryption key. This allows the server to decrypt secrets for syncing with third parties, or to make them available over the API. 

### Enabling SSE

To enable SSE for an App, click on the "Enable SSE" button under the "Encryption" section of the App Settings tab.

Click "Enable" on the confirmation dialog:

Once enabled, the settings page will show you the updated Encryption mode:

### Delete an App

To delete an app, click on the "Delete" button in the Settings tab.

<Warning>
  Deleting an app will permanently delete all Environments, Secrets and Tokens
  associated with it.
