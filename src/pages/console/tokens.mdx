# Tokens

Tokens are used to authenticate with the <a href="/cli">Phase CLI</a>, and grant access to one or more <a href="/console/environments">Environments</a>.

## Service Tokens

These tokens are used to authenticate with Phase from the CLI in headless environments such as CI or build tools, Kubernetes or other 3rd party services.
Service Tokens can be created for a specific <a href="/console/apps">App</a> and must be scoped to one or more <a href="/console/environments">Environments</a>.

### Create a Service Token

Create a Service Token by opening the <a href="/console/apps#service-tokens">Service Tokens</a> tab in an App.

Click on the "Create Service Token" button to open the dialog. Create a name for your token, select the Environment scope for the token, and choose an expiry. Enter your `sudo` password if prompted.

Click on "Create" to create the token. You will be shown the token value on screen. Copy this value and store it somewhere safe.

<Warning>
  After you close this dialog, you won't be able to see the token again!
</Warning>

### Delete a Service Token

To delete a Service Token, hover on the token and click the "Delete Token" button.

## Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

These tokens are used for local development and inherit the same access and permissions as the User account from which they are created.

<Note>
  If you are trying to connect your CLI with the Phase console for local
  development, you do not need to create a PAT manually. Simply initialize
  authentication from the CLI with `phase auth`{' '}
  and following the instructions on screen. A PAT will automatically be created
  for you.

</Note>

### Create a PAT

Create a PAT by clicking on "Personal access tokens" in the sidebar. Click on the "Create User Token" button.
Create an identifiable name for the token, and select an expiry. When you click "Create" the token will be displayed on screen. Copy the value and paste it in your CLI or elsewhere for storage.

<Warning>
  After you close this dialog, you won't be able to see the token again!
</Warning>

### Delete a PAT

To delete a PAT, hover on the token and click the "Delete Token" button.
