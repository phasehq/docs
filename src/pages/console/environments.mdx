# Environments

Environments in Phase allow you to manage your application secrets through various stages of your development process. This guide explains how to create, update, and manage environments in your Phase application.

When you create a new application in Phase, it is automatically initialized with three default environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

These default environments provide a standard structure for managing your application secrets across different stages of your development workflow. You can then customize these or add additional environments as needed.

<Note>
 The ability to create and manage custom environments is available for organizations with a `Phase Pro` or `Enterprise` tier subscription.
</Note>

## Creating a New Environment

To create a new environment:

1. Navigate to the Secrets overview screen inside your app in the Phase console.
2. Click the "+ New Environment" button.

3. In the popup dialog, you'll see a message: "Create a new Environment in this App". Enter a name for your new environment in the "Environment name" field. For example, you might enter "QA" for a quality assurance environment.

   - Hyphens (-)
   - Underscores (_)

4. Click `Create`

Note: All Organisation Admins will have access to this Environment.

### Renaming an Environment

1. Enter the new name in the "Environment name" field.
   
   Environment names can only contain:
   - Lowercase letters (a-z)
   - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Hyphens (-)
   - Underscores (_)
   
2. Click the `Rename` button to apply the change.

<Warning>
Changing the environment name will affect how you construct references to secrets.
</Warning>

### Managing Access

1. In the "Environment Members" section, you can see users who have access to Secrets in this Environment.
2. Click `Manage access` to add or remove user access to this environment.

### Deleting an Environment

1. At the bottom of the dialog, you'll find a "Delete Environment" section.
2. Be aware that deleting an environment will permanently delete this Environment and all associated Secrets and Integrations.
3. Click the `Delete` button to remove the environment. Use this option with caution.

Remember, Organization Owners and Admins have access to all Environments by default. For Developers, you can control Environment access from the App Members screen.

By leveraging these customizable Environments, you can create a workflow that suits your development process, from testing and staging to production deployments.
