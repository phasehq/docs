# Environments

An Environment is a set of [Secrets](/console/secrets). Environments allow you manage your application secrets through various stages of your application development.

There are currently 3 types of Environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

## Environment keys

Each Environment has a unique set of encryption keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt Secrets. Only users with access to these keys can create, view and manage Secrets in an Environment.

Environment keys are derived from an 32-byte cryptographically random seed.

Each Environment also has a 32-byte random salt. This is used as an input when computing Secret Key digests.

## Manage User access

When an [Organisation](/console/organisation) member is given access to an Environment, the Environment seed and salt are asymmetrically encrypted for this user and stored on the backend as an `EnvironmentKey` object.
When access for this user is revoked, this object is deleted.

Organisation Owners and Admins have access to all Environments. You can control which Environments are accessible by a Developer from the [App Members](/console/apps#members) screen.
