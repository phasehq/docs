# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Phase API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Phase offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: User Tokens and Service Tokens. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Both authentication methods are supplied via an `Authorization` header, prefixed by the `Bearer` keyword:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request' }}
curl https://api.phase.dev/v1/secrets?app_id=<app_id>&env=development \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

## Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
