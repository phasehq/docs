# Errors

The Phase API will return approriate status codes and error messages when something goes wrong or a request cannot be processed. Let's look at some status codes and error messages you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the status code and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging.

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Protocol API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="200">
    A 200 status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="400">
    A 400 status code indicates a bad request. This is typically due to a request that's missing some data requried to process the request, such as missing `id` fields.
  </Property>
  <Property name="403">
    A 403 status code indicates an authentication error. Check your [authentication](/public-api/authentication) credentials if you see this error, and make sure the token you're using has the approriate scope for the App and Environment you're trying to access.
  </Property>
  <Property name="409">
    A 409 status code indicates that the requested operation will create a conflict in your secret configuration. This is generally due to attempting to set the `key` of a secret at a given path where this key already exists. 
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error â€” something went wrong with the Phase API.
  </Property>
</Properties>
