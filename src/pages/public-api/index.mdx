# API

The Phase Console exposes a public REST API to allow you to manage secrets programmatically, 
and build your own automations for your stack. The API allows you to create, fetch, update and delete secrets across all your Apps, Environments and Folders. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

The Phase API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). The API accepts data in the request body only in JSON-encoded format. The API uses standard HTTP methods and response codes.

The API also returns specific error messages when something goes wrong. Check out the API [errors page](/public-api/errors) for more details.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with a bearer token in the `Authorization` header of each request. Check out the [API authentication](/public-api/authentication) page for more information on creating and using authentication tokens.

## Base url

If you are using Phase Cloud, the API can be accessed at `https://api.phase.dev`:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request for Phase Cloud' }}
curl https://api.phase.dev/v1/secrets?app_id=<app_id>&env=development \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

If you are self-hosting Phase, the API is exposed at `${HTTP_PROTOTOCL}${HOST}/service/public`. For example, if you are running Phase at `https://localhost`, the API will be accessible at `https://localhost/service/public`

```bash {{ title: 'Example request for Phase Self-hosted' }}
curl https://localhost/service/public/v1/secrets?app_id=<app_id>&env=development \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
## Encryption mode

Certain API endpoints that allow manipulation of encrypted data such as Secrets require Server-side Encryption (SSE) to be enabled for the App. You can enable SSE for an App from the [App settings page](/console/apps#settings).
