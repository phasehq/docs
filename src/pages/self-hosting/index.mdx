# Introduction

Explore deployment options for self-hosting Phase. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To meet various compliance requirements, you may want to self-host Phase instead of using [Phase Cloud](https://console.phase.dev).
Self-hosting the Phase Console allows you to create, manage and deploy keys within your own infrastructure and network.

<Note>
  When self hosting Phase services on your own infrastructure, you assume sole
  responsibility for security, reliability and availability. It is up to you to
  set up valid **TLS certificates**, **web application firewall**, **database
  backups** and **replication**, **DDoS protection**, **rate limiting**,
  **SSOs** etc.
