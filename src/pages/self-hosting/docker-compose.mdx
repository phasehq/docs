# Docker Compose

Learn how to set up the Phase Console using the Docker Compose template. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Keep in mind the steps listed below serve as a rough outline on how to self-hosting Phase Services on your own infrastructure. 

You may: 
- Consider running the Phase Service behind a VPN or a VPC and not to expose it the internet directly. 
- Need to set up things like TLS certificates, web application firewall, database backups and replication, DDoS protection, rate limiting, SSOs etc.

## 1. Install docker on your machine

```fish
# Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

## 2. Download the configurations

**.env** template:

```fish
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phasehq/console/main/.env.example
```

**Docker Compose template**:

```fish
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phasehq/console/main/docker-compose.yml
```

**Nginx config**

```fish
mkdir nginx && wget -O ./nginx/default.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phasehq/console/main/nginx/default.conf
```

**Nginx Dockerfile**

```fish
wget -O ./nginx/Dockerfile  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phasehq/console/main/nginx/Dockerfile
```

## 3. Update your configuration

Please make changes to the `.env` file to suit your environment. Refer to the available [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars)

## 4. Start services

```fish
docker-compose up -d
```

Your Phase console deployment will be available at `https://localhost`. By default Phase will provision a self-signed TLS certificate using nginx. Please use a valid TLS certificate for your own domain in production.
