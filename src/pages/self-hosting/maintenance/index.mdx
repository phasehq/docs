# Database Migrations when Upgrading Phase

Certain versions of Phase may require migrations to the database schema. Understanding how migrations work is crucial for maintaining a healthy Phase instance, especially when upgrading to a new version.

<DocActions /> 

## Migration Requirements

When a new Phase version is released that requires database migrations, it will be clearly mentioned in the [release notes](https://github.com/phasehq/console/releases) with an "Important" notice:

> **Important:** This release includes database migrations that must be run when upgrading to this version.

Always check the release notes before upgrading to ensure you're aware of any migration requirements.

## Migration Configuration

By default, the backend container will automatically run migrations upon starting if the `EXTERNAL_MIGRATION` environment variable is not set or is set to `false`. For more information on this setting, see the [environment variables documentation](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#database-configuration).

## Automatic Migrations

If you're using the official Phase deployment methods such as:
- [Docker Compose deployment template](/self-hosting/docker-compose)
- [Phase Helm chart deployment](/self-hosting/kubernetes)

Migrations will be handled externally by a dedicated job running a standalone version of the backend container. The backend and worker services will depend on this migration job completing successfully before they start. So no additional configuration or action is required on your part.

## Running Migrations Manually

If you've created your own deployment of Phase in a high availability system (i.e., running multiple replicas of the backend/worker services), you'll need to run migrations manually. To do this, create a job that runs the following command in the backend container image, which runs before the backend and worker services start:

```fish
python manage.py migrate
```

Ensure that `EXTERNAL_MIGRATION` is set to `true` in your backend service's environment variables to prevent redundant migrations from being run.

## One-Way Database Changes

It's important to understand that Phase's database migrations are one-way and permanent. Once a migration has been applied to your database, reverting to an older version of Phase (prior to that migration) is not recommended and will likely cause problems. This is because migrations permanently change the database schema.

## Database Backups

Before running any migration, we strongly recommend taking a snapshot or backup of your database instance. This ensures that if you need to revert to an older version of Phase for any reason, you can restore from the backup rather than trying to roll back migrations directly. Having a database system with point in time recovery also can help reduce the burden of manual backups and ensure reliable migrations.

# Audit Log Management

Phase keeps detailed audit logs of secret access, particularly read events. These logs can accumulate quickly, especially in environments with frequent secret polling. To manage database size and performance, you can periodically clean up old audit logs. In future releases we will provide a simpler way to manage this directly from the Phase Console.

## Purging Old Audit Logs

You can use the `purge_app_logs` utility command to safely remove old audit logs. Execute this command from within the `backend` container:

<Note>
Secret creation logs will not be deleted as they are required for the functioning of other features like secret history and point in time recovery.
</Note>

```fish
python manage.py purge_app_logs -h
usage: manage.py purge_app_logs [-h] [--retain RETAIN] [--app-id APP_ID] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] [--settings SETTINGS] [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback] [--no-color] [--force-color] [--skip-checks] org_name

Purge logs older than a specified number of days for a specific organisation or app.

positional arguments:
  org_name              Name of the organisation

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --retain RETAIN       Number of days of logs to retain (default: 30, 0 to delete all)
  --app-id APP_ID       ID of a specific app to delete logs for (optional)
  --version             Show program's version number and exit.
  -v {0,1,2,3}, --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output, 2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g. "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be used.
  --pythonpath PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g. "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on CommandError exceptions.
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  --force-color         Force colorization of the command output.
  --skip-checks         Skip system checks.
```

```fish
# Basic usage - purges logs older than 30 days
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name>

# Purge logs older than 60 days
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --retain 60

# Purge logs for a specific app only
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --app-id <app-id>

# Combine retention period and app-specific purging
python manage.py purge_app_logs <organisation_name> --retain 60 --app-id <app-id>
```

This utility is available on the `backend` and `worker` service containers. You may use the docker command to shell into the container and run the command.

Examples:
```fish
# Via Docker 
docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90

# Via Docker compose
docker compose exec worker python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90

# Via Kubernetes
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> python manage.py purge_app_logs SpaceX --retain 90
```

### Performance considerations

The performance impact of log purging depends on your database instance specifications. For Phase instances with a large number of audit-log events (100+ million), we recommend running the `purge_app_logs` command for the first time during off-peak hours to avoid performance degradation. In our testing, it took about 2.5 minutes to delete 1 million read events on a modest AWS RDS `db.t3.micro` instance.

### Reclaiming Disk Space

<Note>
To reclaim disk space, you will need to run `VACUUM` on the database after purging the logs. See [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-vacuum.html) for more information.
</Note>

After purging logs, follow these steps to reclaim disk space in your PostgreSQL database:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD="$DATABASE_PASSWORD"
psql -h your-database-host -p 5432 -U phase_api -d phase_db
```

2. Verify your current user and database:

```sql
SELECT NOW(), current_user, current_database();
```

Make sure the `current_user` is phase_api and the `current_database` is phase_db.

3. Check the current size of the audit log (`api_secretevent`) table:

```sql
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('api_secretevent')) AS table_data,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('api_secretevent')) AS indexes,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('api_secretevent')) AS total;
```

Example output:

```fish
 table_data | indexes | total 
------------+---------+-------
 8334 MB    | 2393 MB | 10 GB
```

As you can see, the table is **10GB** and has 8.3GB of data.

4. Check for dead tuples (rows) in the table that can be removed:

```sql
SELECT relname,
       n_live_tup,
       n_dead_tup,
       last_vacuum,
       last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'api_secretevent';
```

Example output:
```fish
     relname     | n_live_tup | n_dead_tup | last_vacuum |        last_autovacuum        | last_analyze |       last_autoanalyze        
-----------------+------------+------------+-------------+-------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------
 api_secretevent |    1433160 |      16660 |             | 2025-05-18 04:02:32.280993+00 |              | 2025-05-19 09:05:24.915207+00

# 1,433,160 rows are live and 16,660 rows ☝️ are dead, ready to be removed
```

5. Run the standard vacuum command:

```sql
VACUUM VERBOSE api_secretevent;
```

This will remove the dead tuples and reclaim the space for future use within postgres. Depending on your table size, this operation can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, but is safe to run in parallel with regular operation.

6. Verify the space has been reclaimed:

```sql
SELECT relname,
       n_live_tup,
       n_dead_tup,
       last_vacuum,
       last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze,
       last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'api_secretevent';
```

After vacuuming, the `n_dead_tup` count should be significantly reduced or zero.

```fish
     relname     | n_live_tup | n_dead_tup | last_vacuum |        last_autovacuum        | last_analyze |       last_autoanalyze        
-----------------+------------+------------+-------------+-------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------------
 api_secretevent |    1433160 |      0     |             | 2025-05-18 04:02:32.280993+00 |              | 2025-05-19 09:05:24.915207+00
# 1,433,160 rows are live and 0 ☝️ rows are dead
```

7. **Optional**: For more aggressive space reclamation, you can use `VACUUM FULL`:

<Warning>
`VACUUM FULL` will place an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on your table, preventing reads and writes to the `api_secretevent` table. Only run this command during maintenance windows as you will not be able to access, create or update secrets when this is running.

This method also requires extra disk space, since it writes a new copy of the table and doesn't release the old copy until the operation is complete.
</Warning>

```sql
VACUUM FULL ANALYZE api_secretevent;
```

This command physically removes dead rows and returns disk space to the operating system. Checking the table size afterwards should show a significant reduction:

```sql
SELECT                              
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('api_secretevent')) AS table_data,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('api_secretevent')) AS indexes,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('api_secretevent')) AS total;
```

Example output after `VACUUM FULL`:
```fish
 table_data | indexes | total  
------------+---------+--------
 386 MB     | 103 MB  | 490 MB
```

As shown in this example, table size was reduced from 10GB to **490MB**.

# Resetting Global Network Access Policies

When using [Network Access Policies](/access-control/network), there's a possibility of accidentally locking yourself out of your Phase instance by enabling a global policy that doesn't include your current IP address. If this happens, you can use the following emergency procedure to reset all global network policies.

## Emergency Global Policy Reset

Follow these steps to reset all global network access policies across **all organizations** on your instance:

1. Gain shell access to the backend container:

```fish
# Via Docker 
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh

# Via Docker compose
docker compose exec backend /bin/sh

# Via Kubernetes
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh
```

2. Start a Python shell using Django's management command:

```fish
python manage.py shell
```

3. Run the following Python code to reset all global policies:

```python
from api.models import NetworkAccessPolicy
for policy in NetworkAccessPolicy.objects.all():
    policy.is_global = False
    policy.save()
```

You may have to copy the above code and execute it one line at a time. Given this is Python code, please make sure it's indented correctly when pasting it into the shell.

4. If the command completes without errors, all global network policies have been successfully reset.

5. Exit the Python shell (Ctrl+D or `exit()`) and container shell.

6. You should now be able to log in to your Phase Console and access your organization.

<Note>
This procedure should only be used in emergency situations when you've been locked out of your Phase instance. After regaining access, review and reconfigure your network access policies appropriately to ensure proper security.
