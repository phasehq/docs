# Kubernetes Helm Deployment

Learn how to set up the Phase Console using Helm on Kubernetes. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This guide will walk you through installing the Phase Console on a Kubernetes cluster. By default, the installation includes:

- Phase Console
- Database services (PostgreSQL and Redis) running inside the cluster
- NGINX ingress controller
- Let's Encrypt certificate for TLS

By default, this guide sets up Phase Console with in-cluster databases and an NGINX ingress using a self-signed certificate. However, you have the flexibility to use external databases if preferred. If you're using your own ingress controller and TLS certificates, you can skip steps 1 to 5 of the deployment process.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed & configured with your cluster

## Minimum Requirements

- **CPU**: 2.35 cores (2350m)
- **Memory**: 3.768 GB (3866Mi)
- **Storage**: 50Gi for PostgreSQL

## Deployment

### 1. Install cert-manager

First, add the cert-manager repository:

```fish
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```

Install cert-manager (replace `v1.15.2` with the latest version from https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases):

```fish
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.15.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

Wait for cert-manager to be fully deployed:

```fish
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

### 2. Configure ClusterIssuer

Create a file named `cluster-issuer.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com  # ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your email here
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

Apply the ClusterIssuer:

```fish
kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml
```

### 3. Install NGINX Ingress Controller

```fish
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --set controller.publishService.enabled=true
```

### 4. Get the LoadBalancer IP

Run the following command to get the external IP of the ingress-nginx-controller service:

```fish
kubectl get svc
```

Look for the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `ingress-nginx-controller` service. This may be an IP address or a hostname, depending on your cloud provider.

### 5. Update your DNS

Point your domain (e.g., phase.your-domain.com) to the LoadBalancer IP or hostname obtained in step 4. Use an A/AAAA record for an IP address or a CNAME record for a hostname.

### 6. Add the Phase Helm repository

```fish
helm repo add phase https://helm.phase.dev
helm repo update
```

### 7. Create a values file

Create a file named `phase-values.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  host: "phase.your-domain.com" # ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your domain
  version: "v2.29.11" # ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your preferred version

sso:
  providers: "google" # ðŸ‘ˆ The login provider you want to use

secrets:
  googleClientId: "your_google_oauth_client_id"
  googleClientSecret: "your_google_oauth_client_secret"

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "nginx"
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
  hosts:
    - host: phase.your-domain.com # ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your domain
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - phase.your-domain.com # ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your domain
      secretName: phase-tls

certManager:
  enabled: true
  issuerName: "letsencrypt-prod"
  issuerKind: "ClusterIssuer"
```

You can find the latest version of the Phase Console on the [GitHub release](https://github.com/phasehq/console/releases)

### 8. Install Phase

```fish
helm install phase-console phase/phase -f phase-values.yaml
```

### 9. Verify the deployment

```fish
kubectl get pods
kubectl get ingress
kubectl get certificate
```

Ensure all pods are running, the ingress is correctly configured, and the certificate is issued.

### 10. Access Phase Console

Once DNS propagation is complete and the certificate is issued (which may take a up to tens of minutes), you should be able to access your Phase Console at `https://phase.your-domain.com`.

## Upgrading

To upgrade your Phase Console deployment:

```fish
helm repo update
helm upgrade phase-console phase/phase -f phase-values.yaml
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall Phase Console:

```fish
helm uninstall phase-console
```

## Troubleshooting

If you visit your domain and still see a self-signed certificate, check the logs of the `cm-acme-http-solver` pod:

```fish
kubectl logs -l acme.cert-manager.io/http01-solver=true
```

Note that this pod briefly appears to host the Let's Encrypt challenge and terminates itself after completion. If you don't see the pod, you may need to trigger the certificate issuance process again.
