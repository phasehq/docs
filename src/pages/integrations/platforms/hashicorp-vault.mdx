# Hashicorp Vault

You can use Phase to sync secrets to your Hashicorp Vault instance.

### Prerequisites

- Vault CLI
- Hashicorp Vault instance (self-managed or Hashicorp Cloud)

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted. Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing. See: [Import
  secrets from your Hashicorp Vault
  instance](/integrations/platforms/hashicorp-vault#optional-import-existing-secrets-from-hashicorp-vault-in-phase)
</Warning>

## Step 1: Create a new KV Secrets Engine in Vault (Version 2 - KV v2)

Using namespaces requires access to Vault Enterprise:

1. **Create a Namespace (optional):**

```fish
vault namespace create phase-console-namespace
```

Example:

```fish
λ vault namespace create phase-console-namespace
Key                Value
---                -----
custom_metadata    map[]
id                 jtrH2
path               admin/phase-console-namespace/
```

2. **Switch to the Namespace (optional):**

```fish
export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin/phase-console-namespace
```

3. **Enable Secrets Engine**:
   To enable a KV v2 secrets engine at a specific path (`phase-console-kv-sync` in this case), use the following command:

```fish
vault secrets enable -path=phase-console-kv-sync -version=2 kv
```

## Step 2: Setting Up AppRole Authentication and ACL Policy

1. **Create the Policy File**:
   Write your policy in a file named `my-policy.hcl`. You can do this using a text editor of your choice. Here's the content for `my-policy.hcl`:

```hcl
path "phase-console-kv-sync/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}

path "phase-console-kv-sync/metadata/*" {
  capabilities = ["list", "delete"]
}
```

2. **Apply the Policy Using the CLI**:
   Once you have created `my-policy.hcl` with the desired policy definitions, use the following Vault CLI command to apply the policy:

```fish
vault policy write phase-console-kv-sync-policy my-policy.hcl
```

In this command, `phase-console-kv-sync-policy` is the name of the policy you are creating/updating, and `my-policy.hcl` is the file that contains your policy definitions.

3. **Enable AppRole Authentication**:

```fish
vault auth enable approle
```

4. **Create AppRole with Policy**:

```fish
vault write auth/approle/role/phase-console-kv-sync-approle \
 token_policies="phase-console-kv-sync-policy" \
 token_ttl=15m \
 token_max_ttl=1h
```

5. **Retrieve Role ID and Secret ID**:

- To get the Role ID:

```fish
vault read auth/approle/role/phase-console-kv-sync-approle/role-id
```

- To generate a Secret ID:

```fish
vault write -f auth/approle/role/phase-console-kv-sync-approle/secret-id
```

Example Output:

```fish
vault read auth/approle/role/phase-console-kv-sync-approle/role-id
Key        Value
---        -----
role_id    b9060a13-6222-f41f-8c4b-e55a2c6bef43 👈

vault write -f auth/approle/role/phase-console-kv-sync-approle/secret-id
Key                   Value
---                   -----
secret_id             83e3a891-1b0e-7ce4-d5c9-629b9bccc9d7 👈
secret_id_accessor    9f4abc28-5579-2105-9958-538fe491a42a
secret_id_num_uses    0
secret_id_ttl         0s
```

## Optional: Import existing secrets from Hashicorp Vault in Phase

1. List secrets

```fish
vault kv list -namespace="admin/your-namespace" -format=json "your-secret-path"
```

Example output:

```json
[
  "SECRET_KEY_1",
  "SECRET_KEY_2",
  "SECRET_KEY_3",
  "SECRET_KEY_4",
  "SECRET_KEY_5",
  "SECRET_KEY_6",
  "SECRET_KEY_7",
  "SECRET_KEY_8",
  "SECRET_KEY_9"
]
```

2. Export secrets to a `.env` file

Requires: `jq`, `xargs`

List all secrets your your path, fetch them and write them to a `.env` file.

```fish
vault kv list -namespace="admin/your-namespace" -format=json "your-secret-path" | jq -r '.[]' | \
 xargs -I {} vault kv get -namespace="admin/your-namespace" -format=json "your-secret-path/{}" | \
 jq -r '.data.data | to_entries | .[] | "\(.key)=\(.value)"' > .env
```

Example output:

```fish
head .env
SECRET_KEY_1=dummy_value_1
SECRET_KEY_2=dummy_value_2
SECRET_KEY_3=dummy_value_3
SECRET_KEY_4=dummy_value_4
SECRET_KEY_5=dummy_value_5
SECRET_KEY_6=dummy_value_6
SECRET_KEY_7=dummy_value_7
SECRET_KEY_8=dummy_value_8
SECRET_KEY_9=dummy_value_9
SECRET_KEY_10=dummy_value_10
```

3. Import secret in Phase via the `phase-cli`

```fish
phase secrets import .env --env development
```

4. Delete the `.env` file.

```fish
rm .env
```

## Sync Secrets from Phase

You can automatically sync secrets from your environments in your Phase App to a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
You first need to setup credentials to use for the sync, and then choose a source and destination.

If you are using Hashicorp Cloud Platform (HCP) managed Vault instance you can copy the Public URL by clicking the 📋Public button
![HCL portal vault cluster ](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/vault/hcl-vault-portal.png)

Example: https://vault-cluster-public-vault-gbef9712.627dc7e1.z2.hashicorp.cloud:8200

### Step 1: Set up your Vault credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Create an `role_id` and `secret_id` via the Vault CLI. See [Step 2](#step-2-setting-up-app-role-authentication-and-acl-policy) for instructions.

2. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

![Go to integrations](/assets/images/platform-integrations/integrations-sidebar.png)

![Add a credential](/assets/images/platform-integrations/add-credential-button.png)

3. Click on **Hashicorp Vault**

![Click on Vault](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/vault/vault-create-creds-button.png)

4. Enter your vault instance url under `VAULT ADDR`. Paste your `role_id` and `secret_id` into the `VAULT ROLE ID` and `VAULT SECRET ID` fields respectively. 
`VAULT_NAMESPACE` is optional if you would like Secrets to be synced to a custom namespace.
   Add a descriptive name for these credentials and click **Save**.

### Step 2: Configure Sync

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. If syncing is not yet enabled, click **Enable Syncing** and then **Enable**.

![Enable syncing button](/assets/images/platform-integrations/secret-syncing-sync.png)

![Enable syncing dialog](/assets/images/platform-integrations/secret-syncing-enable.png)

<Note>
  Enabling syncing on your Phase application will allow the server to access
  your encrypted secrets during syncing. This is necessary for the server to
  sync your secrets to third parties. Depending on your threat model you may
  want to consider [self-hosting](/self-hosting) the Phase Console.
</Note>

2. Select **Hashicorp Vault** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

![Create Vault Sync](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/vault/vault-create-sync-button.png)

3. Select the credentials stored in the previous step as the authentication method for this sync, and click **Next**

![Choose sync authentication credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/vault/vault-select-creds.png)

<Note>
  If you see an error message and cannot proceed to the next screen, it is most
  likely an issue with the stored credentials. Verify that you
  created the Vault credentials correctly, and set the right ACL policies. See [Step 2](#step-2-setting-up-app-role-authentication-and-acl-policy) for instructions. 
  You can update your credentials from the Integrations screen if needed.
</Note>

4. Choose the source and destination to sync secrets. Select an Environment as the source for Secrets.
   The KV engine and path will be pre-filled as the destination for syncing. 
   `Vault KV Secret Engine` is prefilled as `phase-console-kv-sync/` as per the instructions in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-new-kv-secrets-engine-in-vault-version-2-kv-v2). If you used a different name for your KV engine, make sure to update it here.
   The `Vault Secret Path` is prefilled as `[app_name]/[env_name]`. You can edit this if desired. 

![Choose sync source and destination](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/vault/vault-configure-sync.png)


5. Once you have selected your desired source and destination, click **Create**.
   The sync has been set up! Secrets will automatically be Synced from your chosen Phase Environment to your Vault instance.
   You can click on the **Manage** button on the Sync card to view sync logs, pause syncing or update authentication credentials.
