# Kubernetes

You can use Phase to sync secrets with applications running in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and create an application.
- Obtain a [`PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`](/console/tokens#service-tokens) for your application, that has access to the environment you are trying to fetch secrets from.

## Using the Phase Kubernetes Operator

This section provides a step-by-step guide to help you get started with the Phase Kubernetes Operator. Feel free to adjust the provided options and configurations to suit your specific needs.

![Phase Cryptography](/assets/images/platform-integrations/kubernetes/phase-kubernetes-operator.webp)

### 1. Install the Operator via Helm

Add the Phase Helm repository and update it:

```fish
helm repo add phase https://helm.phase.dev && helm repo update
```

Install the Phase Secrets Operator:

```fish
helm install phase-secrets-operator phase/phase-kubernetes-operator --set image.tag=v1.2.1
```

<Note>
  It's best practice to specify the version in production environments to avoid
  unintended upgrades. Find available versions on our [GitHub
  releases](https://github.com/phasehq/kubernetes-secrets-operator/releases).
</Note>

### 2. Create a Service Token Secret in Kubernetes

Securely create a Service Token Secret using `read` (recommended for more security as it avoids writing the token to disk or shell history)

Run this command, paste the Phase Service Token and hit enter:

```fish
read -s TOKEN
kubectl create secret generic phase-service-token \
  --from-literal=token=$TOKEN \
  --type=Opaque \
  --namespace=default
unset TOKEN
```

Alternatively, create it directly using `kubectl`:

```fish
kubectl create secret generic phase-service-token \
  --from-literal=token=<TOKEN> \
  --type=Opaque \
  --namespace=default
```

### 3. Deploy the Phase Secrets Operator CR (Custom Resource)

Create a custom resource file: `phase-secrets-operator-cr.yaml`

A Basic custom resource to sync all secrets from a `production` environment in an App in the Phase Console to your Kubernetes cluster as `my-application-secret`, type `Opaque`.

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets.phase.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PhaseSecret
metadata:
  name: example-phase-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  phaseApp: 'your-phase-app' # The name of your Phase application
  phaseAppEnv: 'production' # OPTIONAL - The Phase App Environment to fetch secrets from
  phaseAppEnvPath: '/' # OPTIONAL Path within the Phase application environment to fetch secrets from
  phaseHost: 'https://console.phase.dev' # OPTIONAL - URL of a Phase Console instance
  authentication:
    serviceToken:
      serviceTokenSecretReference:
        secretName: 'phase-service-token' # Name of the Phase Service Token with access to your application
        secretNamespace: 'default'
  managedSecretReferences:
    - secretName: 'my-application-secret' # Name of the Kubernetes managed secret that Phase will sync
      secretNamespace: 'default'
```

Optionally, an example of a more complex custom resource that syncs PKCS12 base64 encoded secrets tagged as `certs` from a `production` environment in an App in the Phase Console to your Kubernetes cluster as `pkcs12`, type `kubernetes.io/tls`.

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets.phase.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PhaseSecret
metadata:
  name: example-phase-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  phaseApp: 'your-phase-app'
  phaseAppEnv: 'production' # OPTIONAL - The Phase App Environment to fetch secrets from
  phaseAppEnvPath: 'certs/' # OPTIONAL Path within the Phase application environment to fetch secrets from
  phaseHost: 'https://console.phase.dev' # OPTIONAL - URL of a Phase Console instance
  authentication:
    serviceToken:
      serviceTokenSecretReference:
        secretName: 'phase-service-token' # Name of the Phase service token with access to your application
        secretNamespace: 'default'
  managedSecretReferences:
    - secretName: 'pkcs12'
      secretNamespace: 'default'
      secretType: 'kubernetes.io/tls' # The secret type to be created
      processors:
        PKCS12_PRIVATE_KEY: # The name of the secret stored in the Phase Console
          asName: 'tls.crt' # The name of the secret to be created inside the secretName secret
          type: 'base64' # Instruct the operator that the secret is already base64 encoded so as not to re-encode it
        PKCS12_CERTIFICATE:
          asName: 'tls.key'
          type: 'base64'
```

Deploy the custom resource:

```fish
kubectl apply -f phase-secrets-operator-cr.yaml
```

Watch for `my-application-secret` managed secret being created:

```fish
watch kubectl get secrets
```

View the secrets:

```fish
kubectl get secret my-application-secret -o yaml
```

<Note>The operator automatically synchronizes secrets every 60 seconds.</Note>

  </Property>
</Properties>

## Secret processors:

### Secret value transformation

In the custom resource, the `processors` field is used to transform and manage secrets. Here's an explanation using PKCS12 secrets as an example:

- `asName`: This parameter renames the secret in compliance to Kubernetes secret formats. For instance, `PKCS12_PRIVATE_KEY` is renamed to `tls.crt`.
- `type`: Specifies the encoding type of the secret. In this case, `base64` indicates that the secret is already base64 encoded.

This setup is specifically for a PKCS12 secret that is pre-encoded in base64. If a secret is set to `type: "plain"`, which is the default, the Kubernetes operator will encode it in base64.

#### Example: **PKCS12** Secret Transformation

Suppose we have the following secrets stored in the Phase service:

1. `PKCS12_PRIVATE_KEY`: A private key in PKCS12 format, already base64 encoded.
2. `PKCS12_CERTIFICATE`: A certificate in PKCS12 format, also already base64 encoded.

In the custom resource, these are handled as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets.phase.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PhaseSecret
metadata:
  name: example-phase-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  phaseAppEnv: 'prod'
  phaseAppEnvTag: 'certs'
  phaseHost: 'https://console.phase.dev'
  authentication:
    serviceToken:
      serviceTokenSecretReference:
        secretName: 'phase-service-token'
        secretNamespace: 'default'
  managedSecretReferences:
    - secretName: 'pkcs12-cert'
      secretNamespace: 'default'
      secretType: 'kubernetes.io/tls'
      processors:
        PKCS12_PRIVATE_KEY:
          asName: 'tls.crt'
          type: 'base64'
        PKCS12_CERTIFICATE:
          asName: 'tls.key'
          type: 'base64'
```

| Secret Stored in Phase Console | Secret synced in Kubernetes Cluster |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `PKCS12_PRIVATE_KEY`           | `tls.crt` (base64 encoded)          |
| `PKCS12_CERTIFICATE`           | `tls.key` (base64 encoded)          |

This table illustrates the transformation of secrets from how they are stored in the Phase Console to how they are saved in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Secret key

Additionally, the following table shows various transformations that can be applied to a generic secret key:

| Type            | Secret stored in Phase | Post transformation |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **camel**       | SECRET_KEY             | secretKey           |
| **upper-camel** | SECRET_KEY             | SecretKey           |
| **lower-snake** | SECRET_KEY             | secret_key          |
| **tf-var**      | SECRET_KEY             | TF_VAR_secret_key   |
| **dotnet-env**  | DB\_\_USER_NAME        | Db\_\_UserName      |
| **lower-kebab** | SECRET_KEY             | secret-key          |

These transformations dictate how the secret keys are renamed or formatted when stored in Kubernetes.

## Using secrets in Kubernetes Deployments

### 1. Using Environment Variables

Expose specific secret(s) from your Kubernetes secret to your deployment as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app-image
          env:
            - name: MY_SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-application-secret
                  key: MY_SECRET_KEY
```

### 2. Using `envFrom` to inject all secrets

Expose all secrets in your Kubernetes secrets to your deployment as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app-image
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: my-application-secret
```

### 3. Mounting secrets as an in-memory volume

Mount secrets as an in-memory volume for scenarios requiring configuration files:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app-image
          volumeMounts:
            - name: secret-volume
              mountPath: /etc/secrets
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: my-application-secret
```

### 4. Auto-Redeploying Deployments When Secrets Change

To ensure that deployments are automatically redeployed when their associated secrets change, add the `secrets.phase.dev/redeploy` annotation with a value of `"true"` to your deployment. This instructs the Phase Kubernetes Operator to redeploy the application whenever the specified secrets are updated.

Here's an example deployment manifest incorporating this approach:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-autoredeploy
  annotations:
    secrets.phase.dev/redeploy: 'true'
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app-autoredeploy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app-autoredeploy
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app-image
          env:
            - name: ANOTHER_SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-application-secret
                  key: ANOTHER_SECRET_KEY
```

### When Operator Triggers Redeployment

The operator triggers redeployment in the following case:

1. **Secret Change Detected**: When the operator updates a Kubernetes secret (either creates a new one, updates an existing one, or deletes and recreates one due to type change), it checks for deployments in the same namespace that have the `REDEPLOY_ANNOTATION` set.

2. **Annotation Present on Deployment**: If a deployment has the annotation `secrets.phase.dev/redeploy` (the value of `REDEPLOY_ANNOTATION`), it indicates that this deployment is reliant on the secret(s) being managed by the operator.

3. **Patching the Deployment for Redeployment**: When such a deployment is found, the operator triggers a redeployment by patching the deployment. This is typically done by updating an annotation on the deployment's pod template, which results in Kubernetes redeploying the pods.

### When Operator Does Not Trigger Redeployment

The operator does not trigger redeployment in the following cases:

1. **No Secret Change**: If there are no changes in the secrets (i.e., the fetched secrets from Phase service are the same as what's already in Kubernetes), the operator does not perform any secret update actions, and consequently, no redeployment is triggered.

2. **Deployment Lacks Annotation**: If a deployment in the namespace does not have the `secrets.phase.dev/redeploy` annotation, it will not be considered for redeployment by the operator, even if it uses the secrets being managed.

3. **Secret Change Not Affecting Deployments**: If the updated secret is not used by any deployment or if the deployments using the secret do not rely on the operator for updates (i.e., they do not have the redeploy annotation), those deployments will not be redeployed.

4. **Errors During Processing**: If there's an error in processing the secrets (e.g., fetching from Phase service, processing, or updating in Kubernetes), and as a result, the secret update doesn’t happen, then no redeployment will be triggered.

### Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: Ensure applications have access only to the secrets they need.
- **RBAC Policies**: Implement Role-Based Access Control policies to restrict access to secrets.

### Troubleshooting and Debugging the Phase Kubernetes Operator

### Check Operator Logs

View logs for potential errors or misconfigurations:

```fish
kubectl get pods
```

```fish
kubectl logs <operator-pod-name>
```

Example (revoked Service Token):

```fish
λ kubectl logs phase-secrets-operator-phase-kubernetes-operator-8b69db6f-f4m8s -f
[2023-11-20 10:54:07,948] kopf._core.engines.a [INFO    ] Initial authentication has been initiated.
[2023-11-20 10:54:07,950] kopf.activities.auth [INFO    ] Activity 'login_via_client' succeeded.
[2023-11-20 10:54:07,951] kopf._core.engines.a [INFO    ] Initial authentication has finished.
[2023-11-20 10:54:08,047] kopf._core.reactor.o [WARNING ] Not enough permissions to watch for resources: changes (creation/deletion/updates) will not be noticed; the resources are only refreshed on operator restarts.
[2023-11-20 10:54:08,692] kopf._core.reactor.r [WARNING ] Cleanup activity is not executed at all due to cancellation.

🚫 Not authorized. Token expired or revoked.
Failed to fetch secrets: The environment 'dev' either does not exist or you do not have access to it.
```

### Verify Operator Status

Ensure the operator is running correctly:

```fish
kubectl get deployment <operator-deployment-name> -n <operator-namespace>
```

### Inspect the Custom Resource (CR)

Check for correct configuration:

```fish
kubectl get phasesecret example-phase-secret -n default -o yaml
```

### Check Events

View Kubernetes events for a timeline of cluster activities:

```fish
kubectl describe phasesecret example-phase-secret -n default
```

### Review Kubernetes Secrets

Verify the presence and content of synced secrets:

```fish
kubectl get secret my-application-secret -n default -o yaml
```

### Examine RBAC Settings

Ensure appropriate permissions are set:

```fish
kubectl get clusterrole <operator-cluster-role>
kubectl get clusterrolebinding <operator-cluster-rolebinding>
```

### Operator Version and Updates

Compare the deployed version with the latest available version:

```fish
helm list -n <operator-namespace>
```

### Resource Limits and Quotas

Check for any resource constraints:

```fish
kubectl describe deployment <operator-deployment-name> -n <operator-namespace>
```

### Uninstall the Operator

Remove the operator using Helm:

```fish
helm uninstall phase-secrets-operator
```

## Using Init Container

You can easily integrate with your kubernetes workload and inject secrets securely using in memory init containers.

1. Create `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` secret.

Via `read` (**More secure**): This method is more secure as the token is not written to disk in a `.yaml` or in shell history.

```fish
read -s TOKEN
kubectl create secret generic phase-service-token \
  --from-literal=PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=$TOKEN \
  --namespace=default
unset TOKEN
```

Alternatively, via `kubectl` inline:

```fish
kubectl create secret generic phase-service-token --from-literal=PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=<TOKEN> --namespace=default
```

2. Here's an example `deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: secrets-volume
          emptyDir:
            medium: Memory
      initContainers:
        - name: fetch-secrets
          image: phasehq/cli:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: secrets-volume
              mountPath: /secrets
          env:
            - name: PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: phase-service-token
                  key: PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN
          command:
            [
              '/bin/sh',
              '-c',
              'phase secrets export --app "my application name" --env development > /secrets/secrets.env',
            ]
      containers:
        - name: main-container
          image: alpine:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: secrets-volume
              mountPath: /secrets
          command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'cat /secrets/secrets.env && sleep 3600']
```

### Security Benefits

1. **Isolation of Responsibilities**: Init containers allow you to separate the responsibility of setting up the environment from the primary purpose of the main container. By using init containers solely to fetch secrets and populate in-memory volumes, you reduce the surface area for potential attacks targeted at the main application.

2. **Transient Nature**: By using in-memory volumes, the data doesn't persist beyond the lifecycle of the pod. When the pod is terminated, the data is lost. This reduces the risk of secret data being left behind.

3. **No Persistent Storage**: Since secrets fetched and placed in an in-memory volume aren't written to any persistent storage, there's no risk of them being exposed if the underlying storage is compromised or improperly decommissioned.

### Security Considerations

1. **In-Memory Exposure**: While the secrets are not persisted to disk, they are still available in the node's RAM. A process or user with sufficient privileges on the node could potentially access data directly from memory.

2. **Swap Space**: If the Kubernetes node is configured with swap, and the node starts swapping memory contents to disk, in-memory data (including secrets) might end up being written to swap space. It's recommended to disable swap on Kubernetes nodes for this (and other) reasons.

3. **Secret Versioning**: If you update a secret, the change won't be automatically propagated to running pods. The pods need to be restarted to pick up the new version of the secret.
