# Cloudflare Pages

You can use Phase to sync secrets with your Cloudflare Pages.

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  the source of truth. Any secrets on the target service will be overwritten or
  deleted. Please import your secrets into Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

<Note>
  For security reasons Phase sets the secret type in Cloudflare Pages
  environment variables as type `Encrypted` for additional protection. This
  means that you will not be able to see the secret value in the Cloudflare
  Pages UI. You can still use the secret in your build commands and environment
  variables.
</Note>

## Step 1: Authentication

### Get your Cloudflare Account ID

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)

2. Click on **Workers & Pages** in the sidebar to the left.

### Save your credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

![Go to integrations](/assets/images/platform-integrations/integrations-sidebar.png)

![Add a credential](/assets/images/platform-integrations/add-credential-button.png)

2. Click on **Cloudflare**

3. Copy and paste your `Account ID` and `Access token` from the Cloudflare dashboard. Add a descriptive name for these credentials and click **Save**

## Step 2: Sync Secrets from Phase

Now that you have set up your Cloudflare account with Phase, you can start creating Syncs to manage your Cloudflare Pages sites.

### Create Sync

1. Select **Cloudflare Pages** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

2. Select the credentials stored in the previous step as the authentication method for this sync, and click **Next**

![Choose sync authentication credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/cloudflare-pages/create-sync-choose-creds.png)

<Note>
  If you see an error message and cannot proceed to the next screen, it is most
  likely an issue with the Account ID or Access Token. Verify that you created
  the Cloudflare credentials correctly and update them from the Integrations
  screen if needed.
</Note>

3. Choose the source and destination to sync secrets. Select an Environment as the source for Secrets.
   Next, select your Cloudflare pages project from the 'Cloudflare project' field, and select either the 'Preview' or 'Production' environment. Once you have selected your desired source and destination, click **Create**.

The sync has been set up! Secrets will automatically be Synced from your chosen Phase Environment to the Cloudflare pages project. You can click on the **Manage** button on the Sync card to view sync logs, pause syncing or update authentication credentials.
