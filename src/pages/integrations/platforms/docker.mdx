# Docker

You can use Phase run to inject secrets to your application process during runtime. There is no need for you to change any code or add a dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Have signed up for the [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev) created an application
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you may supply
  `PHASE_HOST` environment variable with your URL (`https://<HOST>`).
</Note>

## Docker Run

1. Set `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` as a environment variable

```fish
export PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=<>
```

2. Run the container

If you have a `.phase.json` in your working directory:

```fish
docker run --rm --env-file <(phase secrets export) alpine:latest printenv
```

If not you can manually pass your application name and environment:

```fish
docker run --rm --env-file <(phase secrets export --app my-application-name --env production) alpine:latest printenv
```

<Note>
  Docker by default does not support multi-line secrets when using the
  --env-file flag.
</Note>

This technique uses a feature that's available in Bash and some other shells, but might not be available in all environments. If you face any issues, ensure your shell supports process substitution (`<()` syntax).

## Docker `CMD`

1. **Installing the Phase CLI in Your Docker Container**

To ensure the Phase CLI is available within your Docker container, include the appropriate installation commands for your base image's Linux distribution:

<CodeGroup>

```fish {{ title: 'Alpine Linux' }}
RUN apk add --no-cache curl && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | sh
```

```fish {{ title: 'RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux' }}
RUN yum -y install bash sudo curl wget && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash
```

```fish {{ title: 'Ubuntu/Debian' }}
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash sudo curl wget && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

2. **Defining Your Container's Start Command**

Use `CMD` to specify the default command to run when starting your container. This approach allows more flexibility compared to `ENTRYPOINT`, as `CMD` can easily be overridden by providing a different command at the end of the `docker run` statement.

**For a Single Command**:

```fish
FROM your-base-image

# ... (other Docker commands, e.g., installing dependencies, copying source code, etc.)

# Use CMD to define the default command, especially if you don't have a .phase.json in your container image. Include --app and --env flags to specify context if needed.
CMD ["sh", "-c", "phase run --app \"my application name\" yarn start"]
```

**For Multiple Commands**:

```fish
FROM your-base-image

# ... (other Docker commands, e.g., installing dependencies, etc.)

# Use CMD for defining a series of commands. It's crucial to correctly format and escape the commands.
CMD ["sh", "-c", "phase run \"python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver payments-api:8000\""]
```

<Note>
  Opting for `CMD` instead of `ENTRYPOINT` allows for greater flexibility in
  overriding the default command. This can be particularly useful in scenarios
  where the container needs to be started with different commands without
  modifying the Dockerfile.
</Note>

3. **Providing the `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` to Your Container**

```fish
export PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=[pss_env:...]
```

```fish
docker run -e PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN="$PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN" your-application-container
```
