# GitHub Actions

You can use Phase to sync secrets to GitHub Actions.

## Using Phase Console secret syncing

Automatically sync secrets to GitHub Actions form your Phase apps `dev`, `staging`, `prod` environment.

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted. Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you will need to
  set up a new GitHub Oauth Application and supply the
  `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET`
  environment variables. [More
  info](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#third-party-integrations-configuration)
</Note>

Phase will encrypt your secrets via libsodiums `SealedBox` using your GitHub
repository's public key before sending it to GitHub. You wu For more

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

2. Click on **GitHub**

![Click on GitHub](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/select-github-credentials.png)

3. You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize Phase Integration. **Make sure to grant access to any organisations that you wish to with integrate Phase with**. Click Authorize to continue.

4. You will be redirected back to the Phase Console, and your new credentials should be visible under the "Service Credentials" section

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Sync

Now that you have authenticated with GitHub, you can configure syncs for your app

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **GitHub Actions** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

![Create a new sync button](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/create-gh-actions-sync-button.png)

2. Select the credentials stored in the previous step as the authentication method for this sync, and click **Next**

![Choose sync authentication credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/select-gh-credentials.png)

3. Choose the source and destination to sync secrets. Select an Environment as the source for Secrets.
   Next, choose a GitHub repository from the dropdown as the destination to sync Secrets to.

![Configure sync](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/gh-actions-configure-sync.png)

4. Once you have selected your desired source and destination, click **Create**.
   The sync has been set up! Secrets will automatically be Synced from your chosen Phase Environment to the GitHub repository as Secrets that can be used for GitHub Actions.
   You can click on the **Manage** button on the Sync card to view sync logs, pause syncing or update authentication credentials.


#### Using synced secrets in GitHub Actions

Once your secrets are synced, you can access them in your workflows using the `secrets` context. Here's an example workflow showing a typical CI/CD pipeline with different environments and their respective secrets:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]

jobs:
 test:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   permissions:
     contents: read
   environment:
     name: test
   steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     
     - name: Run tests
       env:
         # 👇 Explicitly mention each secret you want to have provisioned to each job
         TEST_DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_DATABASE_URL }}
         TEST_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TEST_API_KEY }}
         STRIPE_TEST_KEY: ${{ secrets.STRIPE_TEST_KEY }}
       run: |
         npm install
         npm test

 build:
   needs: test
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   permissions:
     contents: read
   environment: 
     name: build
   steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     
     - name: Build application
       env:
         # 👇 Explicitly mention each secret you want to have provisioned to each job
         VITE_API_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_API_URL }}
         VITE_SENTRY_DSN: ${{ secrets.VITE_SENTRY_DSN }}
         NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID }}
       run: |
         npm install
         npm run build

 push:
   needs: build
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   permissions:
     contents: read
     packages: write
   environment:
     name: production
   steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     
     - name: Login and push to Docker Hub
       env:
         # 👇 Explicitly mention each secret you want to have provisioned to each job
         DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
         DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
       run: |
         docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -p $DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
         docker build -t myorg/myapp:latest .
         docker push myorg/myapp:latest
```

You can find more information on how to use secrets inside of a GitHub Actions workflow [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-secrets-in-a-workflow).

## Using the Phase CLI

Fetch secrets directly inside your GitHub Actions workflow during runtime without storing them in GitHub.

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you may supply
  `PHASE_HOST` environment variable with your URL (`https://<HOST>`).
</Note>

For detailed cli install options, please see: [Installation](/cli/install)

### Setting `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`:

1. Go to your GitHub Repository.
2. Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. Select `Secrets` from the left sidebar.
4. Click on `New repository secret`.
5. Name it `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` and provide its value.

## Single staged:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build_and_push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install phase-cli
        run: curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | sudo bash

      - name: Export and set environment variables
        env:
          PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          export $(phase secrets export --app "my application name" --env prod DOCKERHUB_USERNAME DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | xargs)

      - name: Build and Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -p $DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
          docker build -t my-image .
          docker push my-image:latest
```

## Multi staged using `phasehq/cli` Docker image:

You can find the Phase CLI docker builds and related images [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/phasehq/cli).

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  export_secrets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      image: phasehq/cli
    env:
      PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - name: Export environment variables
        id: export
        run: |
          # Export secrets
          eval "$(secrets export --app "my application name" --env prod DOCKERHUB_USERNAME DOCKERHUB_TOKEN)"
          
          # Set them in GitHub Actions environment file
          echo "username=$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "token=$DOCKERHUB_TOKEN" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    outputs:
      username: ${{ steps.export.outputs.username }}
      token: ${{ steps.export.outputs.token }}

  build_and_push:
    needs: export_secrets
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build and Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker login -u ${{ needs.export_secrets.outputs.username }} -p ${{ needs.export_secrets.outputs.token }}
          docker build -t my-image .
          docker push my-image:latest
```
