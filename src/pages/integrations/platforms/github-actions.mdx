# GitHub Actions

You can use Phase to sync secrets to GitHub Actions.

## Using Phase Console secret syncing

Automatically sync secrets to GitHub Actions form your Phase apps `dev`, `staging`, `prod` environment.

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted. Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you will need to
  set up a new GitHub Oauth Application and supply the
  `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET`
  environment variables. [More
  info](/self-hosting/configuration/envars#third-party-integrations-configuration)
</Note>

Phase will encrypt your secrets via libsodiums `SealedBox` using your GitHub
repository's public key before sending it to GitHub. You wu For more

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

2. Click on **GitHub**

3. You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize Phase Integration. **Make sure to grant access to any organisations that you wish to with integrate Phase with**. Click Authorize to continue.

4. You will be redirected back to the Phase Console, and your new credentials should be visible under the "Service Credentials" section

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Sync

Now that you have authenticated with GitHub, you can configure syncs for your app

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **GitHub Actions** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

![Create a new sync button](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/create-gh-actions-sync-button.png)

2. Select the credentials stored in the previous step as the authentication method for this sync, and click **Next**

![Choose sync authentication credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/select-gh-credentials.png)

3. Choose the source and destination to sync secrets. Select an Environment as the source for Secrets.
   Next, choose a GitHub repository from the dropdown as the destination to sync Secrets to.

![Configure sync](/assets/images/platform-integrations/github/gh-actions-configure-sync.png)

4. Once you have selected your desired source and destination, click **Create**.
   The sync has been set up! Secrets will automatically be Synced from your chosen Phase Environment to the GitHub repository as Secrets that can be used for GitHub Actions.
   You can click on the **Manage** button on the Sync card to view sync logs, pause syncing or update authentication credentials.

## Using the Phase CLI

Fetch secrets directly inside your GitHub Actions workflow during runtime without storing them in GitHub.

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you may supply
  `PHASE_HOST` environment variable with your URL (`https://<HOST>`).
</Note>

For detailed cli install options, please see: [Installation](/cli/install)

### Setting `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`:

1. Go to your GitHub Repository.
2. Click on the `Settings` tab.
3. Select `Secrets` from the left sidebar.
4. Click on `New repository secret`.
5. Name it `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` and provide its value.
