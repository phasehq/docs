# Terraform Provider

The Phase Terraform Provider allows you to securely fetch secrets stored in Phase directly from your Terraform configurations. This integration enables you to incorporate secret management into your infrastructure-as-code workflows.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x or later
- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

## Preparation

1. Create a new **Phase Service Token** or a **Personal Access Token** (PAT). If you intend to fetch values of personal secret overrides that you have set in your account via the Phase Console or the Phase CLI, please be sure to use a Personal Access Token (PAT).

2. Fetch your Phase **Application ID** (AppID) by going to your application settings in the Phase Console, hovering over UUID under the App section and clicking the `Copy` button:

![hello world](/assets/images/console/settings/application-id.png)

## Step 1: Install the Provider

To use the Phase provider in your Terraform configuration, add the following Terraform block to your configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    phase = {
      source  = "phasehq/phase"
      version = "0.1.1" // replace with latest version
    }
  }
}
```

You can get the latest version of Phase from the official [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/phasehq/phase) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/phasehq/terraform-provider-phase/releases).

## Step 2: Configure the Provider

To configure the provider, you need to provide your Phase API credentials. We recommend using environment variables for sensitive information:

```hcl
provider "phase" {
  phase_token = "pss_service:v1:..." # or "pss_user:v1:..." // A Phase Service Token or a Phase User Token (PAT)
}
```

If you are using a self-hosted instance of Phase, you can specify the API host using the `host` argument in the provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "phase" {
  host        = "https://phase.example.io"
  phase_token = "pss_service:v1:..." # or "pss_user:v1:..." // A Phase Service Token or a Phase User Token (PAT)
}
```

<Note>
You may provide the `phase_token` during runtime via the interactive menu or as an environment variable via any of the following environment variables: `PHASE_TOKEN`, `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `PHASE_PAT_TOKEN`.
</Note>

## Step 3: Using the Provider

### Fetching Secrets

To fetch secrets from Phase, use the `phase_secrets` data source:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "all" {
  env    = "development"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
  path   = ""
}

output "all_secret_keys" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets
  sensitive = true
}
```

☝️ This will fetch all secrets stored inside your Phase application in the development environment.

### Fetching Secrets from a Specific Path

To fetch all secrets under a specific path:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "path_secrets" {
  env    = "production"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
  path   = "/backend"
}

output "backend_secret_keys" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.path_secrets.secrets["JWT_SECRET"]
  sensitive = true
}
```

☝️ This will fetch the `JWT_SECRET` secret from the `/backend` folder inside your Phase application in the production environment.

### Fetching a Single Secret

To fetch a specific secret:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "single" {
  env    = "development"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
}

output "database_url" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.single.secrets["DATABASE_URL"]
  sensitive = true
}
```
☝️ This will fetch the `DATABASE_URL` secret from your Phase application in the development environment.


### Using Secrets in Resources

You can use the fetched secrets in your Terraform configurations like this:

```hcl
resource "some_resource" "example" {
  database_url   = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["DATABASE_URL"]
  api_key        = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["API_KEY"]
  backend_config = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["BACKEND_CONFIG"]
}
```

## Step 4: Run terraform

Initialize Terraform in the root of your project. This will pull all dependencies and configurations:
```fish
terraform init
```

Run Terraform plan to fetch secrets from Phase and preview the changes that will be made:
```fish
terraform plan
```

Execute your Terraform workflows:
```fish
terraform apply
```

## Personal Secret Overrides

Personal Secret Overrides allow individual users to temporarily override the value of a secret for their own use, without affecting the secret's value for other users or systems. Important points to note:

1. **User Token Requirement**: Personal Secret Overrides require authentication with a Phase User Token (Personal Access Token or PAT). Service tokens do not support this feature.

2. **Activation**: Personal Secret Overrides must be activated through the Phase Console or the Phase CLI. They cannot be directly triggered or modified through the Terraform provider.

3. **Behavior**: When active, the Terraform provider automatically uses the overridden value instead of the main secret value when fetching secrets.

4. **Visibility**: Personal Secret Overrides are only visible and applicable to the user who created them.

5. **Temporary Nature**: These overrides are intended for temporary use, such as during development or testing, and should not be relied upon for production configurations.

## Best Practices

1. Use variables or environment variables for the Phase token to keep it out of your Terraform configurations.
2. Utilize Terraform's `sensitive` argument when outputting or using secret values to prevent accidental exposure.
3. Be cautious when using `terraform output` commands, as they may display sensitive information.
