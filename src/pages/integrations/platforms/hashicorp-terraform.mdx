# Terraform Provider

The Phase Terraform Provider allows you to securely retrieve secrets directly from your Terraform configurations. This integration enables you to incorporate secret management into your infrastructure-as-code workflows.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x or later
- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

## Preparation

1. Create a new **Phase Service Token** or a **Personal Access Token** (PAT). If you intend to retrieve values of personal secret overrides set in your account via the Phase Console or the Phase CLI, be sure to use a Personal Access Token (PAT).

2. Fetch your Phase **Application ID** (AppID) by going to your application settings in the Phase Console, hovering over UUID under the App section and clicking the `Copy` button:

![hello world](/assets/images/console/settings/application-id.png)

## Step 1: Install the Provider

To use the Phase provider in your Terraform configuration, add the following Terraform block to your configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    phase = {
      source  = "phasehq/phase"
      version = "0.1.1" // replace with latest version
    }
  }
}
```

You can get the latest version of Phase from the official [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/phasehq/phase) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/phasehq/terraform-provider-phase/releases).

## Step 2: Configure the Provider

To configure the provider, you need to provide your Phase API credentials. We recommend using environment variables for sensitive information:

```hcl
provider "phase" {
  phase_token = "pss_service:v1:..." # or "pss_user:v1:..." // A Phase Service Token or a Phase User Token (PAT)
}
```

If you are using a self-hosted instance of Phase, you can specify the API host using the `host` argument in the provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "phase" {
  host        = "https://phase.example.io"
  phase_token = "pss_service:v1:..." # or "pss_user:v1:..." // A Phase Service Token or a Phase User Token (PAT)
}
```

<Note>
You can provide the `phase_token` at runtime through the interactive menu or as an environment variable using any of the following: `PHASE_TOKEN`, `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `PHASE_PAT_TOKEN`.
</Note>

## Step 3: Using the Provider

### Fetching Secrets

To fetch secrets from Phase, use the `phase_secrets` data source:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "all" {
  env    = "development"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
  path   = ""
}

output "all_secret_keys" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets
  sensitive = true
}
```

☝️ This will fetch all secrets stored inside your Phase application in the development environment.

### Fetching Secrets from a Specific Path

To fetch all secrets under a specific path:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "path_secrets" {
  env    = "production"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
  path   = "/backend"
}

output "backend_secret_keys" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.path_secrets.secrets["JWT_SECRET"]
  sensitive = true
}
```

☝️ This will fetch the `JWT_SECRET` secret from the `/backend` folder inside your Phase application in the production environment.

### Fetching a Single Secret

To fetch a specific secret:

```hcl
data "phase_secrets" "single" {
  env    = "development"
  app_id = "your-app-id"
}

output "database_url" {
  value     = data.phase_secrets.single.secrets["DATABASE_URL"]
  sensitive = true
}
```
☝️ This will fetch the `DATABASE_URL` secret from your Phase application in the development environment.


### Using Secrets in Resources

You can use the fetched secrets in your Terraform configurations like this:

```hcl
resource "some_resource" "example" {
  database_url   = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["DATABASE_URL"]
  api_key        = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["API_KEY"]
  backend_config = data.phase_secrets.all.secrets["BACKEND_CONFIG"]
}
```

## Step 4: Run terraform

Initialize Terraform in the root of your project. This will pull all dependencies and configurations:
```fish
terraform init
```

Run Terraform plan to retrieve secrets from Phase and preview the changes that will be made:
```fish
terraform plan
```

Execute your Terraform workflow:
```fish
terraform apply
```

## Personal Secret Overrides

Personal Secret Overrides allow individual users to temporarily override a secret's value for their own use, without affecting the value for other users or systems. Important points to note:

1. **User Token Requirement**: Personal Secret Overrides require authentication with a Phase User Token (Personal Access Token or PAT). Service tokens do not support this feature.

2. **Activation**: Personal Secret Overrides must be activated through the Phase Console or the Phase CLI. They cannot be directly triggered or modified through the Terraform provider.

3. **Behavior**: When active, the Terraform provider automatically uses the overridden value instead of the main secret value when fetching secrets.

4. **Visibility**: Personal Secret Overrides are only visible and applicable to the user who created them.

## Best Practices

1. Use variables or environment variables for the Phase token to keep it out of your Terraform configurations.
2. Utilize Terraform's `sensitive` argument when outputting or using secret values to prevent accidental exposure.
3. Be cautious when using `terraform output` commands, as these may display sensitive information.
