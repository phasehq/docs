# Railway

You can use Phase to sync secrets with your Railway environments

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted (including those automatically provisioned by Railway for thing like databases). Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.


## Step 1: Authentication

1. Log in your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)

2. Click on your user icon to see the user account options and click on **Account settings**

### Store authentication credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

## Step 2: Set up a secret sync

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **Railway** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

2. Choose the credentials you added in the previous step as the authentication mode, and click **Next**:
