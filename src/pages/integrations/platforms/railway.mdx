# Railway

You can use Phase to sync secrets with your Railway environments

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on the target service will be overwritten /
  deleted (including those automatically provisioned by Railway for things like databases). Please import your secrets into Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

## Step 1: Authentication

1. Log in to your [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard).

2. Click on your user icon to see the user account options and click on **Account Settings**.

3. Click on **Tokens** in the sidebar menu on the left.

4. Create a **New Token** with a descriptive name and select No team. Note: If you do not have a Railway Team, you will not see the Team dropdown as shown in the screenshot below.

Alternatively, if you do have a Railway Team you want to sync secrets to, please make sure you select your Team from the dropdown.

### Store authentication credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section.

2. Click on **Railway**.

3. Enter your Railway `API Token` from the previous step. Enter a descriptive name and click **Save**.

Your credentials will be encrypted and saved. You can view and manage these credentials under *Service Credentials* in the *Integrations* screen.

## Step 2: Set up a secret sync

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **Railway** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

2. Choose the credentials you added in the previous step as the authentication mode, and click **Next**.

3. Next, configure the source and destination for your secrets. Pick an Environment from your App as the source. To configure the destination for the sync, choose a Railway Project from the list of available Projects, as well as an Environment. You can also optionally select a specific Service to sync secrets to. Leave this field blank to sync secrets as Shared Variables in the selected Railway environment.

<Note>
   If you choose to sync to a Railway Service, shared Variables automatically provisioned by Railway, including those belonging to a Railway Deployments such as Databases, will be overwritten by Phase. Please import all secrets into Phase before continuing.
</Note>

4. Once set up, your secrets will automatically be synced to the chosen destination in Railway. You can manage your sync from the *Syncing* tab of your App, or from the *Integrations* screen.
