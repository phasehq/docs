# Railway

You can use Phase to sync secrets with your Railway environments

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted (including those automatically provisioned by Railway for thing like databases). Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.


## Step 1: Authentication

1. Log in your [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard).

2. Click on your user icon to see the user account options and click on **Account Settings**.

3. Click on **Tokens** in the menu side bar in the left.

4. Create a **New Token** with a descriptive name and select No team. If you do not have a Railway Team you will not see the Team dropdown as shown in the screenshot below.

Alternatively, if you do have a Railway Team you want to sync secrets to, please make sure you select your Team form the dropdown.

5. Copy the **API Token**.

### Store authentication credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

2. Click on **Railway**

3. Enter your Railway `API Token` from the previous step. Enter a descriptive name and click **Save**

Your credentials will be encrypted and saved. You can view and manage these credentials under *Service Credentials* in the *Integrations* screen.


## Step 2: Set up a secret sync

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **Railway** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

2. Choose the credentials you added in the previous step as the authentication mode, and click **Next**:

3. Next, configure the source and destination for your secrets. Pick an Environment from your App as the source. To configure the destination for the sync, choose a Railway Project from the list of available Projects, as well as an Environment. You can also optionally select a specific Service to sync secrets to. Leave this field blank to sync secrets as Shared Variables in the selected Railway environment.

4. Once setup, your secrets will automatically be synced to the chosen destination in Railway. You can manage your sync from the *Syncing* tab of your App, or from the *Integrations* screen.
