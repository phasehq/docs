# GitLab CI

You can use Phase to sync secrets to GitLab CI Variables.

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted. Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev) and [create an App](https://console.phase.dev/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encryption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](https://console.phase.dev/apps#settings) tab.

## Step 1: Authenticate with GitLab

### Token Types for Authentication

You can use two types of tokens to authenticate Phase with GitLab: Personal Access Token (PAT) and Group Access Token.

#### **Personal Access Token (PAT)**

A Personal Access Token (PAT) is tied to an individual user's GitLab account. While this can be convenient for personal projects, it has some significant drawbacks:

- **User Dependency**: If the user who created the PAT is removed from a group or deletes their account, the integration using that token will break.
- **Scope Limitation**: The token's permissions are limited to the user's access level.

#### **Group Access Token (GAT)**

A Group Access Token is associated with a GitLab group rather than an individual user. This method is more robust for team and organizational use:

- **Resilience**: The token remains valid as long as the group exists, regardless of changes to individual user accounts.
- **Consistent Access**: All members of the group can use the token for authentication, ensuring continuous integration.

##### Availability of Group Access Tokens

- **GitLab.com**: Group access tokens are available for users with the Premium or Ultimate license tiers. They are not available with a trial license.
- **GitLab Dedicated and Self-Managed Instances**: Group access tokens are available with any license tier.

Given these factors, it is recommended to use Group Access Tokens for authenticating Phase with GitLab to ensure stable and continuous integration, especially in team or organizational environments.

### Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to **User Settings** from the sidebar and click on **Access Tokens**.

![Go to your GitLab Preferences](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-pat-auth-preferences.png)

![Select Access Tokens](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-pat-auth-preferences-access-tokens.png)

2. Click on **Add new token**.

![Click Add new token](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-pat-auth-preferences-access-tokens-add-new-token.png)

3. Fill in the **Token name**, set the `api` Scope, and set the **Expiration date**.

![Create a Personal Access Token](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-pat-auth-preferences-access-tokens-create-pat.png)

<Note>
  If you leave the Expiration date blank, GitLab will create a token with a
  12-month expiry by default. Ensure you set an appropriate expiration date to
  prevent the token from expiring unexpectedly. Also, ensure the `api` scope is
  selected to allow necessary permissions for Phase integration.
</Note>

4. Click **Create personal access token** and copy the token.

### Create a Group Access Token (GAT)

This feature is only available on GitLab if you have the Premium or Ultimate license tier. Group access tokens are not available with a trial license. On GitLab Dedicated and self-managed instances, you can use group access tokens with any license tier.

1. Go to your **GitLab Group**.

![Go to your GitLab Group](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-gat-groups-select.png)

2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Access Tokens**.

![Go to your GitLab Group Settings > Access Tokens](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-gat-groups-setting-access-tokens.png)

3. Click on **Add new token**.

![Click Add new token](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-gat-groups-setting-access-tokens-add-new-token.png)

4. Fill in the **Token name**, select the `Owner` Role, set the `api` Scope, and set the **Expiration date**.

![Create a Group Access Token](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-gat-groups-setting-access-tokens-create-gat.png)

<Note>
  If you leave the Expiration date blank, GitLab will create a token with a
  12-month expiry by default. Ensure you set an appropriate expiration date to
  prevent the token from expiring unexpectedly. Also, ensure the `api` scope is
  selected to allow necessary permissions for Phase integration.
</Note>

5. Click **Create group access token** and copy the token.

### Store authentication credentials in Phase

<Note>
  Your credentials are kept secure with robust application-layer encryption.
  Phase encrypts your credentials directly in the browser and only decrypts them
  in memory to perform sync operations. Your credentials are never stored in
  plaintext.
</Note>

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar and click on **Add credentials** in the 'Service credentials' section

![Go to integrations](/assets/images/platform-integrations/integrations-sidebar.png)

![Add a credential](/assets/images/platform-integrations/add-credential-button.png)

2. Click on **GitLab**

![Click on GitLab](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-creds-button.png)

3. Enter your GitLab instance host and token. Enter a descriptive name for these credentials and click **Save**

![Input GitLab credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-creds-input.png)

Your credentials will be encrypted and saved. You can view and manage these credentials under *Service Credentials* in the *Integrations* screen.

## Step 2: Configure Sync

Now that you have authenticated with GitLab, you can configure syncs for your app.

1. Go to your App in the Phase Console and go to the **Syncing** tab. Select **GitLab CI** under the 'Create a new Sync' menu.

![Create a new sync button](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-create-sync-button.png)

2. Select the credentials stored in the previous step as the authentication method for this sync, and click **Next**.

![Choose sync authentication credentials](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-choose-creds.png)

3. Choose the source and destination to sync secrets. Select an Environment as the source for Secrets.
   Next, choose a GitLab Project or GitLab Group from the dropdown as the destination to sync Secrets to.

   You can optionally also choose to [mask](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#mask-a-cicd-variable) and/or [protect](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) secrets synced to GitLab.

   <Note>
   Masked variables must meet the following criteria in GitLab. 
   If any secrets in the selected environment and path do not meet these requirements, the sync will fail.

   Masked variables must:

   - Be a single line.
   - Be 8 characters or longer.
   - Not match the name of an existing predefined or custom CI/CD variable. 

   Additionally, if variable expansion is enabled, the value can contain only:

   - Characters from the Base64 alphabet (RFC4648).
   - The @, :, ., or ~ characters. 
   </Note>

![Configure sync](/assets/images/platform-integrations/gitlab/gitlab-setup-sync.png)

4. Once you have selected your desired source and destination, click **Create**.
   The sync has been set up! Secrets will automatically be synced from your chosen Phase Environment to the GitLab Project or Group as CI/CD variables.
   You can click on the **Manage** button on the Sync card to view sync logs, pause syncing, or update authentication credentials.

## Using the Phase CLI

Fetch secrets directly inside your GitLab CI pipeline during runtime without storing them in GitLab.

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev) and [create an App](https://console.phase.dev/apps#create-an-app).
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you may supply
  `PHASE_HOST` environment variable with your URL (`https://<HOST>`).
</Note>

For detailed CLI install options, please see: [Installation](/cli/install)

### Setting `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`:

1. Navigate to your project in GitLab.
2. Go to `Settings` > `CI/CD`.
3. Under `Variables`, click on `Expand`.
4. Click on `Add Variable`.
5. Enter the key as `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` and your secret as the value. Save it.
