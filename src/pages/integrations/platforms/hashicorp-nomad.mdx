# Hashicorp Nomad

Deploy secrets in Phase to your Nomad cluster as variables.

<Warning>
  When secret syncing is enabled, secrets stored inside Phase will be treated as
  a source of truth. Any secrets on target service will be overwritten /
  deleted. Please import your secrets in Phase before continuing.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

- Sign up for the [Phase Console](/quickstart) and [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).
- Enable Server-side Encyrption (SSE) for the App from the [Settings](/console/apps#settings) tab.

## Optional: Import exiting secrets from Hashicorp Nomad to Phase

```fish
nomad var get -out json <PATH_TO_YOUR_NOMAD_VARIABLE> | \
jq -r '.Items | to_entries | map("\(.key)=\(.value | tostring)") | .[]' > .env && \
phase secrets import .env --env prod --app my-application
```

## Step 1: Authentication

1. Create a ACL policy that will allow the Phase Console to write secrets to your Nomad cluster.

While choosing a path in your policy you may want to consider the following Nomad variable path conventions.

- Use `nomad/jobs` for access in all tasks in all jobs
- Use `nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job` for access from all tasks in this job
- Use `nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job/web` for access from all tasks in a specific task group
- Use `nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job/web/http` for access from a specific task

### Create a `Client Token` via the Nomad CLI:

First let's start by creating an `ACL Policy`, create a `policy.hcl` file and write a valid policy to it.

Below is a sample policy that you can use to deploy secrets to any path under `nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job*` in the `default` namespace. Feel free to adapt it for your own needs.

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy = "write"

  variables {
    path "nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job*" {
      capabilities = ["write"]
    }
  }
}
```

Apply the policy:

```fish
nomad acl policy apply phase-console-nomad-secret-sync policy.hcl
```

Create the `Client Token` with the above policy.

```fish
nomad acl token create -name='phase-console-nomad-sync-token' -policy='phase-console-nomad-secret-sync'
```

You should see the following output, please grab the `Secret ID` this is our `Client Token`.

```fish
Accessor ID  = 0d39be90-c87a-62dd-66cb-925ddf6086d1
Secret ID    = 6a5bd881-33d4-0199-6276-f8e4816d8b87 ðŸ‘ˆ
Name         = phase-console-nomad-sync-token
Type         = client
Global       = false
Create Time  = 2024-05-13 08:06:15.401142664 +0000 UTC
Expiry Time  = <none>
Create Index = 5285
Modify Index = 5285
Policies     = [phase-console-nomad-secret-sync]

Roles
<none>
```

### Create a `Client Token` via the Nomad web UI:

First, let's start by creating a `ACL Policy`

Go to `Access Control` -> `Policies` -> `+ Create Policy`

Below is a sample policy that you can use to deploy secrets to any path under `nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job*` in the `default` namespace. Feel free to adapt it for your own needs.

```hcl
namespace "default" {
  policy = "write"

  variables {
    path "nomad/jobs/my-nomad-job*" {
      capabilities = ["write"]
    }
  }
}
```

![nomad-ui-policy-create](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/nomad/nomad-ui-policy-create.png)

Click `Save Policy`.

Next, let's create a `Client Token`.

Go to `Access Control` -> `Tokens` -> `+ Create Token`

Enter a descriptive `Token Name`, make sure the `Expiration time` to set to **Never** and the token type in the `Client or Management token?` option is **Client**. Select the policy you previously created from the `Policies` table and click `Save Token`.

![nomad-ui-token-create](/assets/images/platform-integrations/hashicorp/nomad/nomad-ui-token-create.png)

In the following screen you will presented with a `Token Secret` which is the `Client Token`, please select it with your cursor and copy it manually as the copy button that is next to the text box is unreliable and instances of Nomad web UI that are accessed over a non-https connection.

## Step 2: Set up a secret sync
