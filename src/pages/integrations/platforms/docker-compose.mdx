# Docker Compose

You can use Phase run to inject secrets to your application process during runtime. There's no need for you to change any code or add a dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Have signed up for the [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev) and created an application.
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` (Ideally for each of your services).

<Note>
  If you are using a Self-Hosted instance of the Phase Console, you may supply
  `PHASE_HOST` environment variable with your URL (`https://<HOST>`).
</Note>

## Using Phase run

This method uses the Phase CLI to inject secrets into your `docker compose` services without requiring any change in your docker file.

1. Reference the required environment variables directly in your `docker-compose.yml`:

<Note>
  Only the secrets explicitly listed inside the `environment:` map will be
  supplied to your services. Make sure to update the list every time you add a
  new secret in Phase.
</Note>

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: example-service-1
    # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
    environment:
      - SECRET_VAR
      - REDIS_HOST
      - REDIS_PASSWORD
    depends_on:
      - redis

  api:
    build: .
    image: example-service-2
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - ANOTHER_SECRET
      - PG_HOST
      - PG_USER
      - PG_PASSWORD
      - PG_DB_NAME
    depends_on:
      - pgql

  pgql:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - POSTGRES_USER
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      - POSTGRES_DB
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - REDIS_PASSWORD
      - '6379:6379'

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

2. Inject secrets into `docker compose`:

```fish
phase run --app "my application name" docker compose up
```

## Using Docker `CMD`

This method uses the Phase CLI running inside each of your Docker containers to inject secrets to your application at runtime. You will need to install the Phase CLI inside each of your Containers and adjust your `CMD` to add the `phase run` command as prefix.

1. **Installing the Phase CLI in Your Docker Container**

To maintain deterministic Docker builds and prevent accidentally breaking things, it's recommended to specify the `--version` flag. You can find the latest versions of the CLI at the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/phasehq/cli/releases). If no version flag is provided then the latest version of the CLI will be installed.

<CodeGroup>

```fish {{ title: 'Alpine Linux' }}
ENV VERSION=<X.XX.XX>
RUN apk add --no-cache curl && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --version $VERSION
```

```fish {{ title: 'RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux' }}
ENV VERSION=<X.XX.XX>
RUN yum -y install bash sudo curl wget && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- --version $VERSION
```

```fish {{ title: 'Ubuntu/Debian' }}
ENV VERSION=<X.XX.XX>
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash sudo curl wget && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- --version $VERSION
```

</CodeGroup>

2. **Defining Your Container's Start Command**

Use `CMD` to specify the default command to run when starting your container, offering flexibility to override it easily. For initializing the Phase CLI with or without a `.phase.json`, including the `--app` and `--env` flags as context.

**For a Single Command**:

```fish
FROM your-base-image

# ... (other Docker commands, e.g., installing dependencies, copying source code, etc.)

# Use CMD to define the default command. Include --app, --env, and optionally --version flags to specify context.
CMD ["sh", "-c", "phase run --app \"my application name\" --env \"production\" yarn start"]
```

**For Multiple Commands**:

```fish
FROM your-base-image

# ... (other Docker commands, e.g., installing dependencies, etc.)

# Use CMD to define a series of commands with correct format and escaping, including Phase CLI version specification if needed.
CMD ["sh", "-c", "phase run \"python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver payments-api:8000\""]
```

2. Set `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` as an environment variable.

```fish
export PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_WEB=<YOUR_PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_WEB>
export PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_API=<YOUR_PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_API>
```

3. Create or edit your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: example-service-1
    environment:
      - PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=${PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_WEB}

  api:
    build: .
    image: example-service-2
    environment:
      - PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=${PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN_FOR_API}
```

</div>

## Using `eval`

This method let's you export all secrets stored in Phase as environment variable on the host system which can be used by `docker compose`.

1. Export secrets as environment variables in your shell.

```fish
eval $(phase secrets export --app "my application name" --env development)
```

2. Reference these environment variables directly in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: example-service-1
    # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
    environment:
      - SECRET_VAR
      - REDIS_HOST
      - REDIS_PASSWORD
    depends_on:
      - redis

  api:
    build: .
    image: example-service-2
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - ANOTHER_SECRET
      - PG_HOST
      - PG_USER
      - PG_PASSWORD
      - PG_DB_NAME
    depends_on:
      - pgql

  pgql:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - POSTGRES_USER
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      - POSTGRES_DB
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    environment:
      # ðŸ‘‡ Explicitly mention each secret that you want to supply to each service
      - REDIS_PASSWORD
      - '6379:6379'

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

## Using Phase export

This method let's you export all secrets stored in Phase to a file on disk and supply them to `docker compose` via `env_file:`.

1. Export secrets as environment variables in your shell.

```fish
phase secrets export --app "my application name" --env development > secrets.env
```

2. Reference these environment variables directly in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: example-service-1
    # ðŸ‘‡ Path to the file where you exported secrets to
    env_file:
      - secrets.env
    depends_on:
      - redis

  api:
    build: .
    image: example-service-2
    # ðŸ‘‡ Path to the file where you exported secrets to
    env_file:
      - secrets.env
    depends_on:
      - pgql

  pgql:
    image: postgres:latest
    # ðŸ‘‡ Path to the file where you exported secrets to
    env_file:
      - secrets.env
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    # ðŸ‘‡ Path to the file where you exported secrets to
    env_file:
      - secrets.env

volumes:
  pgdata:
```
