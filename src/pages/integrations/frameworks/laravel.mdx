You can use Phase run to inject secrets to your application process during runtime. There is no need for you to change any code or add a dependency.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the CLI](/cli/install)

## Initialize Phase for your [Laravel](https://laravel.com) app

In the root of your application's codebase run:

```fish
phase init
```

## Start your app with Phase

Example

```fish
phase run php artisan serve
```
