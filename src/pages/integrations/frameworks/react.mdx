# React

You can use Phase run to inject secrets to your application process during runtime. There is no need for you to change any code or add a dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Create an account on the Phase Console
- [Install the CLI](/cli/install)

## Initialize Phase for your [React](https://react.dev) app

In the root of your application's codebase run:

```fish
phase init
```

## Start your app with Phase

Example

```fish
phase run npm start
```

Alternatively, you can use `phase run` in your package.json file, so secrets will automatically be injected when you `npm run dev`.

**package.json**:

```json

{
  "name": "McLaren",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "phase run react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "browserslist": "...",
  "dependencies": {...
  },
  "devDependencies": {...
  }
}
```

<Note>React environment variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_`</Note>
