You can use Phase run to inject secrets to your application process during runtime. There is no need for you to change any code or add a dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Create an account on the Phase Console
- [Install the CLI](/cli/install)

## Initialize Phase for your [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) app

In the root of your application's codebase run:

```fish
phase init
```

## Start your app with Phase

Example

```fish
phase run uvicorn main:app --reload
```
