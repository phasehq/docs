## Data Encryption - `XChaCha20-Poly1305`

`ChaCha20-Poly1305` is an authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithm, that combines the ChaCha20 stream cipher with the Poly1305 message authentication code. Its usage in IETF protocols is standardized in RFC 8439.

- `XChaCha20`: This is a variant of the ChaCha20 stream cipher, but it has a longer nonce size. The original ChaCha20 uses a 64-bit nonce, which is a number that should only be used once per key. However, managing nonces can be difficult in practice and reusing a nonce can lead to serious vulnerabilities. XChaCha20 increases the nonce size to 192 bits, significantly reducing the risk of nonce reuse.
- `Poly1305`: This is a message authentication code (MAC) that is used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message. It's secure and efficient, helping to ensure that an encrypted message hasn't been tampered with.

Comparison of `XChaCha20-Poly1305` with `AES-GCM`, a common mode of operation for AES:

- **Nonce Size**: `AES-GCM` uses a 96-bit nonce, whereas XChaCha20 uses a 192-bit nonce. This means XChaCha20 can handle a larger number of messages without nonce reuse, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

- **Block Sizes**: AES is a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits, whereas ChaCha20 is a stream cipher and does not have a block size in the same sense. Instead, it generates a "stream" of pseudo-random bytes which are XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Stream ciphers like ChaCha20 can handle messages of any size without needing padding, whereas block ciphers like AES must pad messages to a multiple of the block size.

- **Resistance to Attacks**: Both AES and ChaCha20 are considered secure against known attacks when used correctly. However, AES can be vulnerable to certain side-channel attacks, such as timing attacks, if not implemented correctly. These attacks rely on information gained from the physical implementation of the cipher, like timing information or power consumption. ChaCha20's design is less susceptible to these kinds of attacks, making it potentially more secure in scenarios where these attacks are a concern.

- **Performance**: On systems with hardware support for AES (like the AES-NI instruction set on many modern CPUs), AES can be very fast. However, on systems without this support, ChaCha20 is faster.
  So, while both `AES-GCM` and `XChaCha20-Poly1305` are considered secure when used correctly, `XChaCha20-Poly1305`'s larger nonce size, resistance to side-channel attacks, and potentially better performance on systems without hardware AES support can make it a better choice in certain scenarios.

Fun fact: `ChaCha20-Poly1305` is currently being used in TLS 1.3, Wireguard and others!

## Key agreement - `X25519`

The `X25519` key exchange algorithm is based on the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol, which uses the mathematics of elliptic curves to generate shared secret keys. In `X25519`, the elliptic curve used is Curve25519, which is a popular and efficient curve that is designed to be secure and resistant to attacks.

The key exchange process begins with each party generating a private key, which is a random 256-bit number. The private key is then used to calculate a public key by performing a scalar multiplication of the private key with a base point on the elliptic curve. The resulting public key is a point on the curve that can be shared with the other party over an insecure channel.

Once both parties have exchanged their public keys, they can each calculate a shared secret key by performing another scalar multiplication, this time using their own private key and the other party's public key. The resulting point on the curve is converted to a 256-bit shared secret key that can be used for subsequent encryption and decryption of messages.

Comparison of `X25519` with `secp256k1` (Koblitz curve):

- **Security**: Both curves provide a similar level of security. However, the design of Curve25519 has been considered more "rigid", meaning that it has been constructed to minimize the number of potential security pitfalls. This contrasts with `secp256k1` which has been criticized for having several potential weaknesses due to the curve's specific parameter choices.

- **Performance**: `X25519` generally provides superior performance due to its efficient curve operations.

## Key-splitting - S4

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm that allows a secret to be divided into multiple shares, each of which can be distributed to different individuals or stored in different locations. The secret can only be reconstructed if a sufficient number of shares are combined together, while individual shares reveal no information about the secret. This technique is often used to distribute encryption keys or to protect sensitive information against loss or theft.

The algorithm was developed by Adi Shamir in 1979 and is based on the mathematics of polynomial interpolation. To use the algorithm, a secret is first chosen, along with a threshold number of shares that must be combined to reconstruct the secret. A random polynomial of degree n-1 is then generated, where n is the total number of shares, and the coefficients of the polynomial are chosen randomly.

Each share is then generated by evaluating the polynomial at a different point. For example, if there are five shares, the polynomial might be evaluated at x=1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, to generate five different shares. Each share consists of a pair of values (x,y), where x is the point at which the polynomial was evaluated and y is the result.

To reconstruct the secret, a minimum number of shares equal to the threshold must be combined together. This is done by using polynomial interpolation to reconstruct the original polynomial from the shares and then evaluating the polynomial at x=0 to obtain the secret.

The strength of Shamir's Secret Sharing lies in the fact that individual shares reveal no information about the secret, as long as the number of shares distributed is greater than the threshold. This means that even if an attacker gains access to some of the shares, they cannot learn anything about the secret unless they obtain enough shares to reach the threshold.

## Key derivation `Argon2`

Argon2id is a modern, high-security password hashing algorithm. It is a variant of the Argon2 algorithm, which won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015. Argon2id is designed to be resistant against a wide range of attacks, including both time-memory trade-off attacks and side-channel attacks.

Argon2id is unique because it combines the advantages of the two other modes of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d. It uses data-independent memory access (like Argon2i), which is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation, while also using data-dependent memory access (like Argon2d), which is preferred for cryptocurrencies and applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks.

Comparison of `Argon2id` with `PBKDF2-SHA512`:

1. **Memory Usage**:
   Argon2id is designed to use a significant amount of memory, which can be configured. This makes it much harder for an attacker to use parallel hardware, such as GPUs or ASICs, to speed up attacks. PBKDF2 does not use a significant amount of memory and therefore can be parallelized on hardware, making brute-force attacks more feasible.

2. **Security**:
   Argon2id provides a higher level of security due to its resistance to GPU cracking attacks, side-channel attacks, and its "memory-hard" properties.
   PBKDF2, while still considered secure, does not have these properties and is potentially more vulnerable to hardware-accelerated brute force attacks.
