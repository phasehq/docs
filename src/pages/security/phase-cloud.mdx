# Overview

Phase has been designed to give app developers access to the best cryptography available while being easy to integrate, manage and observe key usage; all while providing robust security.
This involves various decisions around how encryption keys are generated and managed, how data is encrypted or decrypted, what algorithms are used for various cryptographic operations and how Phase interacts with your applications.
In this document we will first provide an overview of high level concepts before explaining the details of how Phase encryption works.
