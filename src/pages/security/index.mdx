# Security Overview

Phase provides a secure and easy-to-integrate platform for managing application secrets and configurations. Our focus is on strong security, developer experience, and seamless integration to encourage early adoption of security measures.

## Security FAQ:

**What is end-to-end encrypted?**
- Secrets (keys, values) and comments.

**How are secrets encrypted?**
- Phase uses X25519 with XChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption.

**When is data not end-to-end encrypted?**
- When server-side (SSE) encryption is enabled. This allows integration with third-party services and access via a REST API.

**Where is Phase Cloud hosted?**
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Frankfurt (eu-central-1) on AWS.

## Security Objectives

- Provide strong, secure by default end-to-end encrypted configuration and secrets management.
- Abstract the underlying complexity of the system away from the user. 
- Ensure no host server or third party can read or modify secrets, even if compromised.
- Implement reliable, standards-based cryptography with proven libraries.
- Protect against real-world threats without complicating user experience.

## Out of Scope
- Compromise of the client's machine.
- Attacker gaining access to runtime memory state and extracting loaded cryptographic key material.
- Misconfiguration or tampering by a user.
- Network-level attacks that do not target Phase's infrastructure.
- Physical security breaches of the client's premises.
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that do not impact Phase's infrastructure.
- Social engineering attacks targeting individual users.
- Browser vulnerabilities or exploits.
- Loss or theft of the client's physical devices.
- Usage of insecure communication channels outside of Phase's provided interfaces.
