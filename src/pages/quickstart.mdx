# Quickstart

Setup your account and start using Phase encryption in your App in under 3 minutes ‚è±Ô∏è.

This guide will walk you through creating an account and securing it with a recovery phrase and `sudo` password. Then we'll create an App to use with [Phase Encryption](/security/phase-encryption).

## Login and create a Team

You can login to the Phase <a href="https://console.phase.dev" target="_blank">console</a> with Google, GitHub or GitLab.

Once you've logged in you'll be prompted to choose a name for your Team. Your Team name must be unique and alphanumeric. You can't use spaces or special characters. Enter your team name and click `Next`

## Set up account recovery

You will now be shown your account recovery phrase. A recovery phrase is a unique 24 word mnemonic phrase used to encrypt and secure your application keys.

It looks something like this:

```
1. scout  2. angry 3. enter 4. aunt 5. word 6. express
7. enforce 8. measure 9. exhaust 10. genius 11. cook 12. pretty
13. hundred 14. connect 15. hundred 16. marble 17. file 18. spirit
19. era 20. angle 21. kidney 22. bacon 23. coffee 24. review
```

<Warning>
**Store this recovery phrase in a safe place. You won't be shown it again.**

You will need to enter your account recovery phrase to:

- Login to the Phase console from a new device
- Recover from a forgotten `sudo` password

</Warning>

Once you've stored your recovery phrase, click `Next`. You will then be asked to enter the recovery phrase in the correct order on the next screen to confirm it. (In case you have copied it, you can simply paste it.)

## Set up a `sudo` password

The last step is to set up a `sudo` password. A `sudo` password is used to secure data thats stored locally in your browser storage. This is not transmittedto or stored on our backend. The only requirement is for it to be 16 characters long.

Enter a `sudo` password, type it again to confirm, and click `Next`

It will take a few seconds for the Phase console to generate keys on your machine. Once everything is ready, you will be dropped inside the you Team Home. Your Phase account is ready to use! üéâ

## Create an App

In order to use Phase Encryption with your app, you'll need to create an App on Phase.

Create a new app by going to `Apps` from the left sidebar and clicking '+'. Enter an alphanumeric name for your new App along with your `sudo` password and click `Create`. A new set of encryption keys will be created for your new App.

You will be shown a pair of values: `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`
They look something like this:

```js
// Phase APP_ID
ph_app:3a1e0710ced57e060109d8e94f06d52a8e5ffae88ed01506776c5bed664c8a96

// Phase APP_SECRET
pss:a0c02d5de90c58c3c3ab3e5a71c87c9fb7ea134717fb7097bb17284ad4e02ef3:801b342264bfea0c8f8f7058392b99989595059201bc011f6bf7ed813a2f84b05cb5af6aef32cd893ee0930f2904f1194cb912bb2452a5e54f83d588704dbec40037f798e8a4c56aad7d3f4f929f2733e8f:138b021783f08bfe7a4e2f536fc2e743e3ff9b966c9c3af60f427cb3932d647a
```

These values will be used along with the Phase SDKs to encrypt and decrypt data in your application.

You can always come back to view and copy your `APP_ID` This value isn't considered secret.

<Warning>
  Keep the `APP_SECRET` safe. You won't see this value again, and if it is
  leaked or stolen it will allow an attacker to decrypt data in your application
</Warning>

## Next steps

Now that you're now set up with your Phase account and App keys in the Phase Console, [grab an SDK](/sdks) for your stack and start encrypting!
