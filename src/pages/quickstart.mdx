# Quickstart

Setup your account and start using Phase to manage your application secrets in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the following:

- Create a new account on the [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev)
- Create an [App](/console/apps)
- Link the [Phase CLI](/cli/commands) it to your local project and import [Secrets](/console/secrets)
- Inject secrets to your app at runtime

## 1. Login and create an Organisation

You can login to the <a href="https://console.phase.dev" target="_blank"> Phase Console</a> with Google, GitHub or GitLab.

[Setup your account](/console/users#account-keys-and-setup) and [create an Organisation](/console/organisation#create-an-organisation).

## 1.1 Create an App

In order to use Phase with your application, you'll need to [create an App](/console/apps#create-an-app).

Enter a name for your like 'TestApp' and turn off the 'Create example secrets' switch. Click "Create"

## 2. Install the CLI

Next, install the Phase CLI on the platform or operating system of your choice.

<CodeGroup>

```fish {{ title: 'Pip' }}
pip install phase-cli
```

```fish {{ title: 'MacOS' }}
brew install phasehq/cli/phase
```

```fish {{ title: 'Windows' }}
scoop bucket add phasehq https://github.com/phasehq/scoop-cli.git
scoop install phase
```

```fish {{ title: 'Alpine Linux' }}
apk add --no-cache curl && curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | sh
```

```fish {{ title: 'RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux' }}
curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash
```

```fish {{ title: 'Ubuntu/Debian' }}
curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash
```

```fish {{ title: 'Arch Linux' }}
curl -fsSL https://pkg.phase.dev/install.sh | bash
```

```fish {{ title: 'Docker' }}
# Run the latest version
docker run phasehq/cli

# Optional: run a specific version - docker run phasehq/cli:<version>
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/cli/install"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Explore CLI Installation"
  />
</div>

## 2.1 Authenticate the CLI

Once the CLI is installed, you need to authenticate it with your Phase account and App.

Run `phase auth` and choose the "Phase Cloud" option:

```
» phase auth
? Choose your Phase instance type: (Use arrow keys)
 » ☁️ Phase Cloud
   🛠️ Self Hosted
```

This will open the Phase Console in a new tab. Enter your `sudo` password when prompted.

![webauth password](/assets/images/console/quickstart/webauth-password.png)

Once complete, you should see the success screen:

![webauth success](/assets/images/console/quickstart/webauth-success.png)

Go back to your terminal. You should see the following:

```
✅ Authentication successful. Credentials saved in the Phase keyring.
🎉 Welcome to Phase CLI!

    children="Explore CLI Usage"
  />
</div>

## 2.2 Link your project with Phase

Lastly, run `phase init` and select 'TestApp' or the name of the App you created.

```sh
»  phase init
? Select an App: (Use arrow keys)
 » TestApp
   Landing page
   Exit
```

## 2.3 Import your secrets into Phase - **_Optional_**

Next, import your secrets from `.env` file.

```fish
cat .env

DEBUG=yes
BACKEND_API_URL=https://api.myapp.com
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA2OGYBAH6QLWOYDVN
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=6ACbdYki5FISnaiWYZwwyQcAEcnKmNrULTCXw+RQ
```

Run `phase secrets import .env`

```
»  phase secrets import .env
Successfully imported and encrypted 3 secrets.
To view them please run: phase secrets list
```

Once done, get rid of your `.env` file now, its best practice not to leave secrets in plain text on disk:

```fish
rm .env
```

The environment variables in your `.env` file have now been encrypted and imported into your Phase App. Go back to your App in the Phase Console to view them:

![console secrets](/assets/images/console/quickstart/quickstart-console-secrets.png)

Our environment variables have been imported into the `Development` Environment by default. Now we can edit, manage and deploy these secrets from Phase.

## 3. Inject secrets

To inject secrets locally into your application, simply prefix the normal command you would use with

```fish
phase run [command]

# Start node dev server
phase run yarn dev

# Chaining multiple commands together
phase run "printenv | grep AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
```

For example, instead of `yarn dev`, simply run `phase run yarn dev`. Your secrets will be decrypted and injected into your application process at runtime, and you can access them in your code as usual.

## Next steps

Now that you have setup your account and connected it to your local project, you can explore all that Phase has to offer.
