  'This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Phase console.'

# Quickstart

In this guide we will cover how to your create a new:
- Create a new **Phase account**
- Set up account **recovery**
- Create your first **app** and **app keys**

... in under ⏱️ **3 minutes**.  {{ className: 'lead' }}


## 1. Log into the Phase console

- Launch the Phase console and log in with:
  - Google
  - GitHub
  - GitLab

- Choose a Team - A unique alphanumeric name for your team on the Phase console

## 2. Set up account recovery
A recovery phrase is a unique 24 word mnemonic used to encrypt and secure your application keys. 

It looks something like this:
```
1. scout  2. angry 3. enter 4. aunt 5. word 6. express 
7. enforce 8. measure 9. exhaust 10. genius 11. cook 12. pretty
13. hundred 14. connect 15. hundred 16. marble 17. file 18. spirit
19. era 20. angle 21. kidney 22. bacon 23. coffee 24. review
```
Only you have access to it. Please store it in a secure place.

<Note>
Depending on your threat model, you may choose to save it using:
- A password manager
- Write it down or printing it on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe eg. a vault
- [Etch in a steel plate](https://www.blockplate.com/products/blockplate-24)
- [A hardware secuiry module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) - Coming soon

Keep in mind each method has its operational security tradeoffs and limitations.
</Note>

You will need to enter this phase:
- To recover from a forgotten device password
- Login to Phase console from a new device

You will be required to enter the recovery phrase in the correct order in the next screen to confirm it. (In case you have copied it, you can simply paste it.)

## 3. Set up a device password
A device password is used to secure data thats stored locally in your browser storage. This is not transmitted or stored on your backend. The only requirement is that its 16 characters long.

It will take a few seconds for the Phase console to generate keys on your machine.

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
