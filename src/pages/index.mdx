# Introduction
#### Phase abstracts the complexity of encryptions tools and makes it easy for developers to secure sensitive data in their applications. {{ className: 'lead' }}

---
# TL;DR
1. **üîí Encrypt / decrypt data in your web apps with just 2 lines of code**
2. **üîë Easily create, deploy and maintain control of your keys**
3. **üìã Monitor key usage with logs**

# The problem

- Example: See the list of US companies within the last 24 months that have had a breach of unsecured ‚Äòprotected health information‚Äô affecting 500 or more individuals.
https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf
- The majority of B2B SaaS products collect sensitive customer data in order to execute business logic and provide core product value. This creates significant resistance to their adoption because of the risks and liabilities associated with the storage and transport of this data by a third party
- Security conscious prospective buyers don‚Äôt trust their data sitting in a public cloud SaaS but aren't up for the headaches of going on-prem either
- This forces B2B companies to try and implement their own application layer encryption
- Encryption schemes and protocols are complicated. Lack of operational security understanding and key mismanagement can have serious undiscovered implications which can defeat the entire purpose and even cause permanent loss of data


Introduce CI / CD
Hire a team and migrate onto kubernetes
Introduce terraform or other IaC
Hiring good DevOps engineers is hard
This leads to anti-patterns such as
Observability of services and infrastructure is an after-thought
Platform security best practices are not built into the product from the get-go
Planning for a stack migration from say, Elastic Beanstalk onto ECS
Navigating the multitude of tools to be integrated is a pain.
This is a detraction from building stuff that users want
This is a multi person-year evolution that all orgs go through.

# The solution
- Phase SDKs sit within your application and scale with it, no need to add and managae another micro service.

Argonaut is a control center to manage infrastructure, deployments, and third party apps on your cloud which provides:

    Git based workflows for infrastructure and application management
    Fully integrated with your favorite tools (github, AWS, GCP, terraform, datadog, grafana, ...) and a full fledged third party app library
    You have full source and configurations of what is running on your cloud
    No lock in. We hate lock-in as much as you do.
    Made for fast paced startups, with no limitations on what you can do external to Argonaut

# Who is it for?
- Developers
- B2B software as a service (SaaS)
    You just don't have the time for infrastructure automation and CI/CD.
        Bonus: you are doing this fully aware that you will have to pay the debt a few months down the line?
    You need to migrate off Heroku to AWS but don't want to think about it now
        Eg. once your credits run out, or you need services like RDS, S3, managed queues etc.
        You split your resources between heroku and aws
    You think setting up observability stacks and letsencrypt are should be automated in 2021
    You want multiple environments setup without hassle
    You want to get started with kubernetes but are skeptical of the challenges (and rightfully so)
    You can't seem to find a DevOps person

    If you answered YES to any of those questions, we should talk.

--- ü§ù Offer

    Argonaut will handle everything for you (devops as a service) - without you lifting a finger
    Infrastructure as code, and CI/CD - no lock in, you have full source
    Observability stacks and dashboards for monitoring your apps

    Prioritizing any features for your use cases

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community. {{ className: 'lead' }}
