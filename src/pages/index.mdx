# Introduction
#### Phase abstracts the complexity of encryption and key management tools and makes it easy for developers to secure sensitive data in their applications. {{ className: 'lead' }}

---
# TL;DR
1. **üîí Encrypt / decrypt data in your web apps with just 2 lines of code**
2. **üîë Easily create, deploy and maintain control of your keys**
3. **üìã Monitor key usage with logs**

# The problem
1. [Data braches](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf) are a 'when' not a 'if' problem. [Encryption](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures) is an effective solution
2. But, adding encryption to your app; encrypting existing is difficult, complex and time consuming
3. Relying on automatic database / bucket is useless since the data is automatically decrypted when retrieved. A breach is a single [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/#example-attack-scenarios) or a [IAM misconfiguration](https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks) away
4. Rolling your own encryption is risky. 
4. Solving all of this is outside the scope of developers and a destraction from shipping features
- Example: [See the list of US companies within the last 24 months that have had a breach of unsecured ‚Äòprotected health information‚Äô affecting 500 or more individuals.](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)

# The solution
1. [Open Source SDKs](/sdks) that let you [encrypt](/encrypt) / [decrypt](/decrypt) data with 2 lines of code
2. Seamlessly generate and deploy keys to all your apps
3. Decrypt and process data in memory only when you need to 
4. Phase SDKs sit within your application, run on your own cloud and scale with it
5. Observe and manage key usage with [Phase console](/quickstart)
6. No lock in. You own your keys

# Who is it for?
- Developers
- B2B software as a service (SaaS)
    You just don't have the time for infrastructure automation and CI/CD.
        Bonus: you are doing this fully aware that you will have to pay the debt a few months down the line?
    You need to migrate off Heroku to AWS but don't want to think about it now
        Eg. once your credits run out, or you need services like RDS, S3, managed queues etc.
        You split your resources between heroku and aws
    You think setting up observability stacks and letsencrypt are should be automated in 2021
    You want multiple environments setup without hassle
    You want to get started with kubernetes but are skeptical of the challenges (and rightfully so)
    You can't seem to find a DevOps person

    If you answered YES to any of those questions, we should talk.

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community. {{ className: 'lead' }}
