# Introduction

Phase is an open source (open core) end-to-end encrypted platform for creating, managing, deploying secrets and environment variables across your infrastructure. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Phase has been designed to give app developers access to some of the best cryptography available while being easy to integrate, manage and observe key usage; all while providing robust security. This involves various decisions around how and where encryption keys are generated, deployed and managed, how data is encrypted or decrypted, what algorithms are used for various cryptographic operations and how Phase interacts with your applications.

Phase is designed to solve the problem for securely

## Phase CLI

Import, encrypt and inject secrets in your application within seconds. Zero code change required.
