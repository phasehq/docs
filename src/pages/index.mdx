# Introduction

Phase is an open source end-to-end encrypted platform for creating, managing, deploying secrets and environment variables across your infrastructure. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## ‚è±Ô∏è TL;DR

- üéØ Import secrets from `.env` files and [inject](/quickstart#3-inject-secrets) into any application or containers at runtime
- üî• Automate deployments of secrets to platforms like [GitHub Actions](/integrations/platforms/github-actions), [Kubernetes](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes), [AWS](/integrations/platforms/aws-secrets-manager) and more.
- üë®‚Äçüíª Forget about complicated IAM policies - [Invite teammates](/console/users#add-users-to-an-organisation) and sync secrets like it's Google Docs.
- ‚ö° Sane defaults - out of the box [dev, stag, prod environments](/console/environments) setup, audit-logs, permissions etc.
