# Introduction
#### Phase abstracts the complexity of encryption and key management and makes it easy for developers to secure sensitive data in their applications. {{ className: 'lead' }}

---
# TL;DR
1. ðŸ”’ Crypto - Encrypt / decrypt data in your web apps with just 2 lines of code
2. ðŸ”‘ Key management - Easily create, deploy and maintain control of your keys
3. ðŸ“‹ Observability - Monitor key usage with logs

# The problem
1. [Data braches](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf) are a 'when' not a 'if' problem. [Encryption](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures) is an effective solution
2. However, adding encryption to your app; encrypting existing data is difficult, complex and time consuming.
3. Relying on automatic database / bucket encrypting is useless since the data is automatically decrypted when retrieved. A breach is a single [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/#example-attack-scenarios) or a [IAM misconfiguration](https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks) away.
4. Rolling your own crypto and with hard coded keys is a securty minefield.
5. Solving all of this is outside the scope of developers and a destraction from shipping features.

Example: [See the list of US companies in the last 24 months that have suffered a data breach of unsecured â€˜protected health informationâ€™ affecting 500 or more individuals.](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)

# The solution
1. [Open Source SDKs](/sdks) that let you [encrypt](/encrypt) / [decrypt](/decrypt) data with 2 lines of code.
2. Seamlessly generate and deploy keys securely to all your apps.
3. Decrypt and process data in memory only when you need to.
4. Phase SDKs sit within your application, run on your own cloud and scale with it.
5. Observe and manage key usage with the [Phase Console](/quickstart).
6. No lock in. You own your keys
