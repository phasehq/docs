# Introduction

Open Source end-to-end encrypted key management platform for developers to encrypt data in their apps. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Phase has been designed to give app developers access to some of the best cryptography available while being easy to integrate, manage and observe key usage; all while providing robust security. This involves various decisions around how and where encryption keys are generated, deployed and managed, how data is encrypted or decrypted, what algorithms are used for various cryptographic operations and how Phase interacts with your applications.

**Encrypt data in your apps with secure self-custodial keys.**
