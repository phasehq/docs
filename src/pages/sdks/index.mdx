# SDKs

Lightweight, secure and open-source crypto SDKs for your stack. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Phase SDKs allow you use [Phase Encryption](/security/overview) within your applications. Client SDKs allow you encrypt data directly in your users' browsers, while Server SDKs allow you to both encrypt and decrypt data in your server-side applications.
