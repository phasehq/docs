# Python SDK

SDK to integrate Phase in server-side applications running Python.

The Python SDK allows you to encrypt data server-side, as well as decrypt data.

- [phase-dev](https://pypi.org/project/phase-dev/) on PyPI
- [github.com/phasehq/python-sdk](https://github.com/phasehq/python-sdk)

<Note>
  In order to use the Python SDK you will need to create a new App on the Phase
  Console. Add the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` to your application, preferably
  using environment variables. [Quick start &raquo;](/quickstart)
</Note>

## Install the SDK

The Python SDK is distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/phase-dev/). You can install it using the following command.

<CodeGroup title="Install">

    ```bash {{ title: 'pip' }}
    pip install phase-dev
    ```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Import the SDK

Once installed, you can import the Python SDK into your project.

```python
from phase import Phase;
```

---

## Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`.

```python
phase = Phase(APP_ID, APP_SECRET)
```

<Note>
If you are self-hosting Phase, you must also provide the protocol and host for your Phase instance:

```python
PHASE_INSTANCE_HOST = 'https://localhost'

phase = Phase(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, PHASE_INSTANCE_HOST)
```

</Note>

## Usage

### Encrypt

The `encrypt` API allows you to encrypt data. It returns an encrypted string in the Phase Ciphertext format.

```python
ciphertext = phase.encrypt('hello world')
```

### Decrypt

The `decrypt` API allows you to decrypt a Phase Ciphertext string. It returns a plaintext string.

```python
plaintext = phase.decrypt(ciphertext)
```
