# Python SDK

SDK to integrate Phase in server-side applications running Python.

The Python SDK allows you to encrypt data server-side, as well as decrypt data.

- [PyPi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-node)

<Note>
  In order to use the Python SDK you will need to create a new App on the Phase
  Console. Add the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` to your application, preferably
  using environment variables. [Quick start &raquo;](/quickstart)
</Note>

## Install the SDK

The Python SDK is distributed via [pip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-node). You can install it using the following command for your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup title="Install">

    ```bash {{ title: 'pip' }}
    pip install phase-sdk
    ```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Import the SDK

Once installed, you can import the Python SDK into your project.

```python
from phase import Phase;
```

---

## Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`.

```python
phase = Phase(APP_ID, APP_SECRET)
```

---

## Usage

### Encrypt

The `encrypt` API allows you to encrypt data.

```python
ciphertext = phase.encrypt("hello world");
```

### Decrypt

The `decrypt` API allows you to decrypt a Phase encrypted data `ph:` string.

```python
plaintext = phase.decrypt(ciphertext);
```
