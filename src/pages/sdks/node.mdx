# Node.js SDK

SDK to integrate Phase in server-side applications running Node.js.

The Node.js SDK allows you to encrypt data server-side, as well as decrypt data.

- [@phase.dev/phase-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-node)
- [github.com/phasehq/node-sdk](https://github.com/phasehq/node-sdk)

<Note>
  In order to use the Node.js SDK you will need to create a new App on the Phase
  Console. Add the `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` to your application, preferably
  using environment variables. [Quick start &raquo;](/quickstart)
</Note>

## Install the SDK

The Node.js SDK is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-node). You can install it using the following command for your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup title="Install">

    ```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
    npm i @phase.dev/phase-node
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
    yarn add @phase.dev/phase-node
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
    pnpm i @phase.dev/phase-node
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Import the SDK

Once installed, you can import the Node.js SDK into your project.

```js
const Phase = require('@phase.dev/phase-node')
```

---

## Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`.

```js
const phase = new Phase(APP_ID, APP_SECRET)
```

<Note>
If you are self-hosting Phase, you must also provide the protocol and host for your Phase instance:

```js
const PHASE_INSTANCE_HOST = 'https://localhost'

const phase = new Phase(APP_ID, APP_SECRET, PHASE_INSTANCE_HOST)
```

</Note>

## Usage

### Encrypt

The `encrypt` API allows you to encrypt data. It returns a `Promise` that resolves in a encrypted string in the Phase Ciphertext format, so you need to `await` it.

```js
const ciphertext = await phase.encrypt('hello world')
```

### Decrypt

The `decrypt` API allows you to decrypt a Phase Ciphertext string. It returns a `Promise` that resolves in a plaintext string, so you need to `await` it.

```js
const plaintext = await phase.decrypt(ciphertext)
```
