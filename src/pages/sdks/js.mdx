# JavaScript SDK

SDK to integrate Phase in client-side Javascript applications.

The JavaScript SDK can be used with any JavaScript client-side application to encrypt data client-side, in your user's browsers.

- [@phase.dev/phase-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-js)
- [github.com/phasehq/client-js-sdk](https://github.com/phasehq/client-js-sdk)

<Note>
  In order to use the JavaScript SDK you will need to create a new App and get
  an `APP_ID` from the Phase Console. Add the `APP_ID` to your application,
  preferably using an environment variable. [Quick start &raquo;](/quickstart)
</Note>

## Install the SDK

The JavaScript SDK is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phase.dev/phase-js). You can install it using the following command for your preferred package manager.

<CodeGroup title="Install">

    ```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
    npm i @phase.dev/phase-js
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
    yarn add @phase.dev/phase-js
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
    pnpm i @phase.dev/phase-js
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Import the SDK

Once installed, you can import the JavaScript SDK into your project.

```js
import Phase from '@phase.dev/phase-js'
```

---

## Initialize the SDK

In order to use the SDK, you need to initialize it with your `APP_ID`.

```js
const phase = new Phase(APP_ID)
```

---

## Usage

Now that you have initialized the SDK, you can use it to encrypt data.

### Encrypt

The `encrypt` API allows you to encrypt a string. It returns a `Promise` that resolves in a encrypted string in the Phase Ciphertext format, so you need to `await` it.

```js
const ciphertext = await phase.encrypt('hello world')
```
