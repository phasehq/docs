## 💻 `auth`

Authenticate with Phase using the CLI on your own machine. The `phase auth` command lets you log in to either Phase Cloud or a Self-hosted instance of Phase. You have two authentication methods:

1. **Webauth (Default)**: This automated method opens the Phase Console in your default browser for authentication. You'll simply enter your `sudo` password to authenticate the CLI seamlessly. For Self-Hosted instances, you'll be prompted to enter the host URL.

Note that during this process, an ephemeral X25519 keypair is generated and a crypto sealed box is used for enhanced security and no tokens or private keys are exchanged in plain text.

2. **Token**: A manual method where you create a Personal Access Token in the Phase Console and supply it to the CLI. For Self-Hosted instances, you'll need to provide the host URL along with your email and Phase Personal Access Token.

<Note>
  If you're running the CLI in a headless environment (e.g., CI/CD, Docker
  container, bash script), pass the `PHASE_HOST` and `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN`
  environment variables. For more details, see [Environment
  Variables](commands#environment-variables).
</Note>

```bash
> phase auth
? Choose your Phase instance type: (Use arrow keys)
 » ☁️ Phase Cloud
   🛠️ Self Hosted
```

- `mode`: Choose the mode of authentication (`token`, `webauth`). Default: `webauth`

For `token` mode, provide the following:

- Host URL - _Only for Self-hosted instances_
- Email
- Phase Personal Access Token

Obtain a Phase Personal Access Token from [Phase Console](https://console.phase.dev) -> Personal Access Tokens -> Create User Token.

Example:

```bash
» phase auth
? Choose your Phase instance type: ☁️ Phase Cloud
Please authenticate via the Phase Console: https://console.phase.dev/webauth/OTM3MC00ZWViYmI1MGVlMTU3ZTliOWZk...
```

This opens the Phase Console in a new tab. Enter your `sudo` password when prompted. The CLI securely receives your credentials via encrypted POST requests to finalize authentication. If you are already authenticated, it will display your email address and provide instructions for switching accounts.

Once complete, you should see a success screen. Return to your terminal to find:

```bash
» phase auth
? Choose your Phase instance type: ☁️ Phase Cloud
Please authenticate via the Phase Console: https://console.phase.dev/webauth/OTM3MC00ZWViYmI1MGVlMTU3ZTliOWZkZT...

✅ Authentication successful. Credentials saved in the Phase keyring.
🎉 Welcome to Phase CLI!

## 🔗 `init`

Link your local application or project to your Phase app. The `phase init` command creates a `.phase.json` file in the root of your projects which holds important contexts for the `phase` cli, so you don't have to pass arguments repetitively. This file does not contain any sensitive information and can be check into your git repo.

Usage:

```fish
> phase init
```

During the process, you'll be asked to select an app previously created in the Phase Console:

```fish
> phase init
? Select an App: [use arrow keys]

   ferrari
 » keyspace
   inception
   Exit
```

Choosing an app will create a `.phase.json` configuration file in your project's working directory:

```fish
> phase init
? Select an App: keyspace
✅ Initialization completed successfully.

> cat .phase.json
{
  "version": "1",
  "phaseApp": "keyspace",
  "appId": "511f26b7-5b56-47f3-920e-a4edb9cdbf3c",
  "defaultEnv": "Development",
  "envId": "679bf2bc-9353-4fe0-a84f-825f284c8f8d"
}
```

**Tip**: Modify the `defaultEnv` in `.phase.json` to set the default environment context for the Phase CLI. For example, `"defaultEnv": "production"`.

---

## 🚀 `run`

Run and inject secrets into your app with the ability to override default settings.

<CliDemo castFile="phase-run.cast" terminalFontSize="small" />

Usage:

```fish
> phase run [--env ENVIRONMENT] [--app APP_NAME] [--tags TAGS] [command_to_run]
```

- `command_to_run`: The command you wish to run, such as `yarn dev`. You can also chain multiple command together by wrapping them in double quotes, example: `phase run "printenv | grep secret"`
- `--env`: (Optional) Specify the environment (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`). Supports partial string matching eg. `prod` for `production` Default is `development`
- `--path`: (Optional) Specific path under which to fetch secrets from and inject into your application. Default is '/'. Pass an empty string `""` to fetch secrets from all paths.
- `--app`: (Optional) Name of your Phase application. Use this if you don't have a `.phase.json` file in your project directory or want to override it.
- `--app-id`: (Optional) ID of your Phase application. Takes precedence over `--app` if both are provided.
- `--tags`: (Optional) Comma-separated list of tags to filter secrets.

The `run` command executes your specified shell command, setting environment variables to the secrets fetched from Phase. It resolves cross-environment and local references in secrets.

Examples:

```fish
> phase run yarn dev
```

```fish
> phase run --env dev "printenv | grep DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=7842cc89c5a703acdf4797e0f063e1851734cea0677ad9382158cfcee26195df
```

Injecting [Referenced secrets](/cli/commands#secret-referencing):

```fish
> phase secrets get PROD_AWS_KEY --env dev
KEY 🗝️                | VALUE ✨
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROD_AWS_KEY         | ⛓️` ${prod.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}

> phase run --env dev "printenv | grep PROD_AWS_KEY"
PROD_AWS_KEY=AKIA2OGYBAH63UA3VNFG

# In the event a user doesn't have access to prod / production environment
> phase run --env dev "printenv | grep PROD_AWS_KEY"
⚠️ Warning: The environment 'prod' for key 'PROD_AWS_KEY' either does not exist or you do not have access to it. Reference AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID not found. Ignoring...
PROD_AWS_KEY=
```

Chaining multiple commands:

```fish
> phase run --env prod "python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver backend:8000"
```

**Additional Notes**:

- The `phase run` only exposes secrets to your applications runtime and not to the rest of your system for security reasons.
- When specifying tags with `--tags`, only secrets matching these tags will be injected into the environment.
- Cross-environment and local references in secrets are automatically resolved and injected. Warnings are issued if any references cannot be resolved.
- Errors during the command execution or secret fetching process will result in an appropriate error message and termination of the process.

To update the documentation for the `secrets` command based on the CLI source code, I'll incorporate additional options and details that are currently not covered in the documentation. Here's how the revised version would look:

## 🗝️ `secrets`

Manage your secrets with various sub-commands.

### 📇 `secrets list`

List all the secrets in a specified environment, with options to show uncensored secrets, filter by app, and filter by tags.

<CliDemo castFile="phase-secrets-list.cast" terminalFontSize="small" />

- `⛓️`: Indicates a cross-environment reference to a secret in another environment.
- `🏷️`: Indicates a tag associated with a secret.
- `💬`: Indicates a comment associated with a secret.
- `🔏`: Indicates a personal secret, visible only to the user who set it.

### 🔍 `secrets get`

Retrieve detailed information about a specific secret, with the ability to specify the application and filter by tags.

Usage:

```fish
> phase secrets get KEY [--env ENVIRONMENT] [--app APP_NAME] [--tags TAGS]
```

- `KEY`: The key associated with the secret you want to fetch.
- `--env`: (Optional) Specify the environment in which to search for the secret.
- `--path`: (Optional) The path from which to fetch the secret from. Default is '/'

        "local-development"
    ],
    "comment": "This is only for local development. NOT to be used in production."
}
```

**Notes**:

- The `get` command provides a JSON-formatted output including key details such as the secret value, whether it's overridden, tags associated with it, and any comments.
- Using the `--tags` option allows you to filter the secret based on specific tags.

### 💳 `secrets create`

Create a new secret with options to input the value manually, read from stdin, or generate a random value of specified type and length.

Usage:

```fish
> phase secrets create [KEY] [--env ENVIRONMENT] [--app APP_NAME] [--random TYPE] [--length LENGTH] [--override]
```

- `KEY`: (Optional) The key for the new secret. It will be converted to uppercase. If the value is not provided as an argument, it will be read from stdin.

Examples:

```fish
# Create a secret by reading the value from stdin
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | phase secrets create SSH_PRIVATE_KEY

# Create a secret with a randomly generated hexadecimal value of 32 characters
> phase secrets create RAND --random hex --length 32
```

**Notes**:

- `key128` : 16 Byte high entropy base64 encoded symmetric key - suitable for AES-128
- `key256` : 32 Byte high entropy base64 encoded symmetric key - suitable for use with ChaCha20 or AES-256

### 📝 `secrets update`

### 🗑️ `secrets delete`

Delete one or more secrets from a specified environment, with an option to specify the application.

Usage:

```fish
> phase secrets delete KEYS... [--env ENVIRONMENT] [--app APP_NAME]
```

- `KEYS...`: One or more keys of the secrets to be deleted. Separate multiple keys with spaces.
- `--env`: (Optional) Specify the environment from which the secrets will be deleted.
- `--app`: (Optional) Name of your Phase application. Use this to override the `.phase.json` file or when it's not present in your project directory.

Successfully deleted the secrets.
```

**Notes**:

- The `delete` command can be used to remove a single secret or multiple secrets at once by providing their keys as arguments.
- If you have an `.phase.json` file in your project directory, it will be used to determine the default application. Use the `--app` option to override this behavior.

### 📩 `secrets import`

# Import secrets from the .env file into the 'prod' environment
> phase secrets import .env --env prod
Successfully imported and encrypted 2 secrets.
To view them please run: phase secrets list --env prod

# List imported secrets in the 'prod' environment
> phase secrets list --env prod

# Optional: Remove the .env file if no longer needed
> rm .env
```

**Notes**:

- The `import` command reads key-value pairs from the specified `.env` file and imports them as secrets into the chosen environment.
- If an `.phase.json` file exists in your project directory, it will determine the default application. The `--app` option can be used to override this behavior.

### 🥡 `secrets export`

Export secrets from your Phase environment, with options to filter by keys, tags, and to specify the export format.

Usage:

```fish
> phase secrets export [KEYS...] [--env ENVIRONMENT] [--app APP_NAME] [--tags TAGS] [--format FORMAT]

```

```
# Export only specific secrets in the 'prod' environment
> phase secrets export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --env prod
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="V5yWXDe82Gohf9DYBhpatYZ74a5fiKfJVx8rx6W1"
```

```
# Export all secrets in the 'dev' environment to a .env file
> phase secrets export --env dev > .env.example
```

```fish
# Export secrets with specific tags in 'dev' environment to JSON format
> phase secrets export --env dev --tags "tag1,tag2" --format json
{
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "V5yWXDe82Gohf9DYBhpatYZ74a5fiKfJVx8rx6W1",
  "DB_NAME": "XP1_LM",

  - `kv`: Simple key-value pairs with uppercase keys and raw values
  - `json`: JavaScript Object Notation, useful for integration with various tools and languages
  - `csv`: Comma-Separated Values, a simple text format for tabular data
  - `yaml`: Human-readable data serialization format, often used for configuration files
  - `xml`: Extensible Markup Language, suitable for complex data structures
  - `toml`: Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, a readable configuration file format
  - `hcl`: HashiCorp Configuration Language, used in HashiCorp tools like Terraform
  - `ini`: A simple format often used for configuration files
  - `java_properties`: Key-value pair format commonly used in Java applications
- Use the `--tags` option to filter secrets by tags, which supports partial matching and considers underscores as spaces.
- If an `.phase.json` file exists in your project directory, it will determine the default application. The `--app` option can be used to override this behavior.

## Secret referencing

You can set a value of a secret to a value of another by simply pointing to it via the following syntax.

### Secret referencing syntax:

| Value reference syntax | Environment | Path | Secret Key Being Referenced | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| `${KEY}` | same environment | `/` | KEY | Local reference in the same environment and path root (/). |
| `${staging.DEBUG}` | `staging` | `/` (root of staging environment) | DEBUG | Cross-environment reference to a secret at the root (/). |
| `${production./frontend/SECRET_KEY}` | `production` | `/frontend/` | SECRET_KEY | Cross-environment reference to a secret in a specific path. |
| `${/backend/payments/STRIPE_KEY}` | same environment | `/backend/payments/` | STRIPE_KEY | Local reference with a specified path within the same environment. |

For more information see: [Phase Console Secrets](/console/secrets)

Values prefixed with a `🔗` indicate a local secret being referenced, whereas values prefixed with `⛓️` indicate cross environment secret value being referenced ie. development, staging, prod.

**Examples**:

### Local environment secret referencing:

```fish
> phase secrets list --env prod --show
KEY 🗝️                   | VALUE ✨
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DB_NAME                  | XP1_LM
DB_USER                  | j_mclaren
DB_PASSWORD              | 6c37810ec6e74ec3228416d2844564fceb99ebd94b29f4334c244db011630b0e
DB_HOST                  | mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT                  | 5432
DATABASE_URL             | 🔗 postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}

> phase run "printenv | grep DATABASE_URL"
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://j_mclaren:6c37810ec6e74ec3228416d2844564fceb99ebd94b29f4334c244db011630b0e@mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/XP1_LM
```

The database connection string `postgresql://` is referencing `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` and `DB_NAME` from the same environment (dev/development)

### Local environment secret referencing inside a folder:

The following database credentials are inside of `postgres` folder

```fish
DB_NAME                  | XP1_LM
DB_USER                  | j_mclaren
DB_PASSWORD              | 6c37810ec6e74ec3228416d2844564fceb99ebd94b29f4334c244db011630b0e
DB_HOST                  | mc-laren-prod-db.c9ufzjtplsaq.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT                  | 5432
```

```fish
> phase secrets list --env prod --show
